\subsubsection*{4. Validating practical feasibility}
Most studies have seen to ignore real-world limitations like GDPR compliance and means of scalability \citep{kapoor2024comparative}. \hyperref[research-gap-4]{\uline{\textbf{Research Gap 4}}} is satisfied by this study via the following, although it isn't a production-ready deployment.

\begin{itemize}
  \item XAI-powered phishing detection models will be tested under realistic workloads (\hyperref[sub-research-q1]{\uline{\textbf{Sub Research Question 1}}}).
  \item Overseeing the computational resource requirements of integrating XAI explanations (\hyperref[research-gap-8]{\uline{\textbf{Research Gap 8}}}).
\end{itemize}
