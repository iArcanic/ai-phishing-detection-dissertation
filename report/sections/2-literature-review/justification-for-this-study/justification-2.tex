\subsubsection*{2. Pioneering user-centric XAI evaluation}
The literature review highlighted the neglect of user's interactions with XAI explanations \citep{vo2024securing}, regardless of evidence into how poor UI warning dialog design can lead to more risk of being tricked by phishing emails \citep{greco2023explaining}. \hyperref[research-gap-2]{\uline{\textbf{Research Gap 2}}} is met by:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Carrying out usability surveys to understand how XAI explanations affect a user's trust and decision-making processes (\hyperref[objective-4]{\uline{\textbf{Objective 4}}}).
  \item Taking inspiration from \cite{anderson2015polymorphic} to design polymorphic alerts that is specifically tailored to end-user psychology (\hyperref[sub-research-q2]{\uline{\textbf{Sub Research Question 2}}}).
\end{itemize}
