\subsubsection*{3. Establishing standardised XAI metrics}
As identified, there is a lack of a standardised framework in which to evaluate XAI effectiveness \citep{reddy2023explainable}. The study fulfills \hyperref[research-gap-3]{\uline{\textbf{Research Gap 3}}} by:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Proposing potential metrics in which explanation fidelity, comprehensibility, and fairness can be evaluated by (\hyperref[objective-3]{\uline{\textbf{Objective 3}}}).
  \item Align with \cite{shendkar2024enhancing}'s framework but adapt it to phishing email detection contexts.
\end{itemize}
