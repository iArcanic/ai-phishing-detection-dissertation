\subsubsection*{5. Advancing interdisciplinary explanations}
Current XAI models output explanations that assume that the end-user has adequate technical expertise \citep{greco2023explaining}, with little to no inclusion for non-technical users. This study responds to \hyperref[research-gap-9]{\uline{\textbf{Research Gap 9}}} by:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Modifying explanations to different levels of user roles in usability tests (\hyperref[objective-4]{\uline{\textbf{Objective 4}}}).
  \item Implementing user feedback loops as a way to refine explanations in an interative manner.
\end{itemize}
