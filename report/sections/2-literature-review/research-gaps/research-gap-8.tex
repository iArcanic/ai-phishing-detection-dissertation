\subsubsection*{Research gap 8: Computational overhead of XAI integration}\label{research-gap-8}
Studies which attempt real-time deployment are often limited by the computational costs of the inherent model as well as the additional XAI techniques, i.e. SHAP/LIME latency \citep{kapoor2024comparative}. There isn't much numerical analysis on efficiency and speed. Aligned with \hyperref[sub-research-q4]{\uline{\textbf{Sub Research Question 4}}}.
