\subsubsection*{Research gap 1: Interpretability vs. performance trade-offs in phishing detection systems}\label{research-gap-1}
Higher accuracy models, such as transformers and random forest, often lack many interpretability features. More explainable models like EBM may underperform (\citeauthor{do2024integrated}, \citeyear{do2024integrated}; \citeauthor{greco2023explaining}, \citeyear{greco2023explaining}). There are few studies that find the optimal balance between the two. Aligned with \hyperref[objective-2]{\uline{\textbf{Objective 2}}} and \hyperref[sub-research-q4]{\uline{\textbf{Sub Research Question 4}}}.
