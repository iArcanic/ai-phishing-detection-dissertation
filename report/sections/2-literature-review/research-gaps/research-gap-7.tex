\subsubsection*{Research gap 7: Bias and fairness in XAI interpretability explanations}\label{research-gap-7}
Some studies show that XAI techniques can be influenced from biases in training data, for example flagging emails from specific domains as phishing by default \citep{hanif2021survey}. As of now, there are no studies that account for this bias for phishing-specific XAI outcomes. Aligned with \hyperref[objective-3]{\uline{\textbf{Objective 3}}}.
