\subsubsection*{Research gap 5: Inadequate integration of XAI with high performing AI models}\label{research-gap-5}
Whilst its known that SHAP/LIME can be applied to traditional ML models, such as random forest and decision trees, their integration with more complex models like transformers or hybrid architectuers is not substantially explored (\citeauthor{alzahrani2024explainable}, \citeyear{alzahrani2024explainable}; \citeauthor{lim2025explicate}, \citeyear{lim2025explicate}). Aligned with \hyperref[objective-1]{\uline{\textbf{Objective 1}}} and \hyperref[objective-2]{\uline{\textbf{Objective 2}}}.
