\subsubsection*{Research gap 9: Interdisciplinary explanations for non-technical users}\label{research-gap-9}
XAI outputs from models that studies have developed often assume technical expertise of the user \citep{greco2023explaining}. There are no current frameworks that adapt XAI explanations to various user roles, such as from a SOC analyst to an end-user. Aligned with \hyperref[objective-4]{\uline{\textbf{Objective 4}}} and \hyperref[sub-research-q2]{\uline{\textbf{Sub Research Question 2}}}.
