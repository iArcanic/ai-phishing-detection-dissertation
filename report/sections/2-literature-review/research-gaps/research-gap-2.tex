\subsubsection*{Research gap 2: Lack of a user-centric XAI design}\label{research-gap-2}
Most of the existing XAI-powered systems focus on technical explanations of outputs, such as with SHAP/LIME. They fail to evaluate how users interact with them (\citeauthor{vo2024securing}, \citeyear{vo2024securing}; \citeauthor{anderson2015polymorphic}, \citeyear{anderson2015polymorphic}). Aligned with \hyperref[objective-4]{\uline{\textbf{Objective 4}}} and \hyperref[sub-research-q2]{\uline{\textbf{Sub Research Question 2}}}.
