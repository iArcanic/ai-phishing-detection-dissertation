\subsubsection*{Adversarial evolution and scalability}
In \cite{kapoor2024comparative}'s research, they also comment on the constant evolution of sophisticated tactics introduced by attackers, such a deep fakes, new social enginnering tactics, and context-aware attacks -- all with the goal of exploiting human technology. They mention that it is important to factor in an "arms race" between AI models being trained on new data and attackers coming up with new intrusion methods. Traditional models, apart from overfitting, suffer from their sensitivity to parameter turning such as SVM \citep{andriu2023adaptive}. Furthermore, it is a challenge to scale these models given the ever-growing needs of an organisation, as the system must be able to both maintain its performance and optimal detection to deal with increasing workloads, with a lack of real-time implementations and studies, observed by \cite{atlam2022business}.
