\subsubsection*{Future directions}
To conclude, it is safe to say that there are plenty of integrations of XAI with phishing detection models, often achieving competitive accuracies along with interpretability features. A range of XAI techniques are implemented, the most common being SHAP and LIME, with some uses of EBM. However, there lies some areas that need to be addressed as emphasised by most studies' future works.
