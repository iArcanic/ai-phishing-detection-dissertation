\subsubsection*{Introduction to XAI and its importance}
There are many studies that put forward the solution of XAI to address interpretability and transparency issues \citep{roshan2022using} associated with systems that employ ML techniques. The goal of XAI here is to serve as a means to understand and inspire confidence in an AI's decision making processes \citep{khanom2025pd_ebm}, from the input all the way through to the output (\citeauthor{jawale2020jeevn}, \citeyear{jawale2020jeevn}; \citeauthor{sanchez2022phishing}, \citeyear{sanchez2022phishing}), with use cases for analysts being able to differentiate between false positives and negatives \citep{van2024applicability}. In particular, there are several existing studies into how XAI plays a role in the context of phishing detection, with a study by \cite{alzahrani2024explainable} proving that both high accuracies (97\%) and reasonable explainability features can be achieved. The importance of such explainable systems is stressed by \cite{shendkar2024enhancing} and further literature comments on how theres been a recent interest for outcome explanations for textual and document based classification tasks (\citeauthor{martens2014explaining}, \citeyear{martens2014explaining}; \citeauthor{lei2016rationalizing}, \citeyear{lei2016rationalizing}).
