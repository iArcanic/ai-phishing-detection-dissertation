\subsubsection*{ML models for phishing detection}
AI-driven phishing detection systems have therefore emerged as a potential alternative to traditional machine learning, as stated by \cite{do2022deep}, especially in this context. In particular, they mention how deep learning models, can be applied to detect phishing content in various areas such as websites, emails, mobile devices, VoIP, and so on, achieving competitive accuracies when compared to traditional ML models. \cite{tang2021survey} supports this, by also mentioning how machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks, linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, SVM, KNN, and random forest, have a high suitablity when it comes to a supervised classification tasks like phishing detection. Specifically, models such as random forest have boasted a high performance in a study conducted by \cite{gupta2021novel}, achieving an accuracy of 99.57\%. Research by \citep{kapoor2024comparative} also advocated for the outstanding performance of random forest, especially in its ability to maintain a classification balance, minimising the risk of false positives and negatives.Other models such as KNN and random forest have achieved similar accuracies, 97.2\%, as seen in the study by \cite{zamir2020phishing}. But all studies note on agree on using a hybrid approach of several models in combination can lead to better detection performance, with an example of using multiple classifiers in \cite{alsariera2020ai} or using a hybrid feature selection process as showcased by \cite{hamid2013using}.
