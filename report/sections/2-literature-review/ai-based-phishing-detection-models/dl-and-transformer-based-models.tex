\subsubsection*{DL and transformer-based models}
Additionally, transformer based models have been shown to perform equally as well, with a study by \cite{do2024integrated} presenting a model with a 99.71\% detection accuracy. Another study by \cite{shirazi2022towards} agrees with this notion, particularly highlighting the significance of pre-trained transformer models showing substantial performance compared to other current approaches, despite their lower accuracy scores. Their advantage lies in the fact that they do not require pre-processing as certain features -- making them highly adaptable for feature-driven detection. Not ony that, but the study claims that transformer-based models are more practical for organisations, since they are faster and require less training time \citep{shirazi2022towards}.
