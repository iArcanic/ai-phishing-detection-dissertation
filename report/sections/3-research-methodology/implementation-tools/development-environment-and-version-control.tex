\subsubsection*{Development environment and version control}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Google Colaboratory}: The main development environment for interactively coding Jupyter Notebooks, and giving free access to computational resources. Also comes with pre-install common data science libraries.
  \item \textbf{Jupyter Notebooks}: The main format for the code and used for all stages of the project. Allows for iterative and intuitive Python development, complete with inline Markdown documentation and code outputs.
  \item \textbf{Git and GitHub}: Chosen as the VCS of the projects code for managing documentation, Jupyter Notebooks, utility scripts, trained models, raw and preprocessed datasets. Git LFS was used to handle files larger than 100 MB.
  \item \texttt{requirements.txt}: For local runtime instances of the Jupyter Notebooks, the \texttt{requirements.txt} file is used to install the necessary Python libraries on the target system.
\end{itemize}
