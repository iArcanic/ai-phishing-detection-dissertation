\subsection*{Research questions}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Primary research question:}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textit{How can Explainable AI (XAI) improve the usability and trustworthiness of AI-based phishing detection systems without compromising on accuracy?}
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Sub-questions:}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item What are the current limitations of AI phishing detection models in terms of their usability and interpretability?
      \item How do the interpretability features affect a user's trust building and decision-making processes?
      \item How can XAI techniques, i.e. SHAP and LIME, be integrated efficiently on top of existing AI phishing detection models?
      \item What trade-offs, if any, arise between the performance and interpretability of the AI phishing detection model?
    \end{enumerate}
