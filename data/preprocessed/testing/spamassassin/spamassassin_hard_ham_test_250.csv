submit your opinion here . here are some representative responses from last week's question on who should take the blame for web sites not being compatible in every browser ""web builders should be doing as much as possible to support the broadest possible usage by their target audience"" a little over half the responses put the onus of compatibility on builders. ""there are far less browser makers than there are web builders and users. so it doesn't make sense for users or web builders to do that job does it?."" after web builders, browser manufacturers got the most blame, although this response makes the best argument. ""the ordinary users are one group most at fault since they tend to stick to only one browser."" few responses said users should take responsibility, as most respondents fall into the web user category. ""as a professional designer, i say proprietary code is downright evil, no matter who it comes fromand no matter what nifty trick it does."" quite a number of web builders wrote in, with many taking responsibility while noting the difficulty of testing in every browser. ""because web pages are viewed 90 percent of the time by ie it is understandable that the time spent to make a site compatible with the remaining tiny minority has to be justified."" a few responses quoted server logs, making the point that it's not cost efficient to make sites compatible for people who choose a lowmarket share browser. the email address for your subscription is unsubscribe

readers mourn gene kan peertopeer pioneer dies, macworld kicks off in manhattan, and the paypalebay merger is not going so well. laura lindhe, executive editor, cnet tech trends 1 gene kan  gnutella opensource guru gene kan, who died on june 29 in an apparent suicide, was clearly beloved by the cnet community. last week, search requests for information on 25yearold kan far outweighed the kind of requests on products and companies i usually see. a pioneer in the peertopeer space, many credit him with legitimizing file sharingmaking it about more than music, according to wired news. 2 macworld  the annual apple lovefest in new york is always a good show, whether or not steve jobs has anything real to announce. so far, it looks like apple has already surprised a few by announcing the release of quicktime 6.0 (see no. 7), which many thought would get bogged down in a licensing quagmire. 3 paypal  it's been a rocky road thus far for the ebay and paypal deal. soon after ebay announced it was buying paypal for $1.5 billion, shareholders filed a lawsuit claiming that paypal's price tag was too low. this week, paypal is being subpoenaed by the new york attorney general in regard to its involvement with online gambling transactions. 4 wifi  i'm just going to leave this common term for 802.11 up on the buzz meter permanently. this time, wifi is getting interest because of a possible pact between tech heavyweights, including intel, att wireless, and verizon communications, to build wireless access places across the nation in public areas where people would want to launch onto the net, such as airports. 5 emac  this is the foreducationonly computer that consumers wanted so badly that apple released it to them. the cnet review is out, and here's the word the emac is what the

""3rd quarter worst for stocks since '87,"" read the denver post, repeating a popular figure reached by tallying the dow and sp's percentage losses. the new york daily news counted percentage losses for the month only and declared it the worst september since 1937. everyone predicted a lousy september 2002, so the phrase ""selffulfilling prophecy"" does spring to mind. so does the phrase ""gloom and doom."" ""every day for the last three months, the market has erased $73 of wealth, including saturdays, sundays and holidays, for every person living in the united states,"" said the san jose mercury news. ""countless investors are starting to wonder if stocks will ever go up again,"" wrote usa today. in a more plausible statement, thestreet.com's aaron task said recent declines ""demonstrated once again the folly of investors' repeated attempts to pinpoint a bottom"" and ""disabuse(d) them of the idea that the best time to buy is when things look worst, if only because recent history has shown stocks can go from terrible to awful and beyond."" ok, breathe. go read the comics or something. feeling better? good, because there's more. the new york post, in small enough words for everyone to understand, made the public service announcement ""beware! october is a very bad month for the stock market."" and you shouldn't take candy from strangers, either. the post's john crudele, a market curmudgeon before it was in style, warned, ""this market is very dangerous, even if things look like they couldn't get any worse."" detroit free press columnist susan tompor agreed that ""the next round of statements could indeed look pretty nasty."" we have to agree the stock market is bad. the economy is bad. it's going to get worse before it gets better, and that may take a while. the ""bottom"" is, technically, zero. be cautious, yes, but don't let the media's bipolar disorder ruin your day. just like dotcoms weren't really a new economy, a bear market isn't the end of the world.  jen muehlbauer no happy endings in september bear drags stocks deeply into den market's september is worst since 1937 dow posts worst month in 4 years market's worst quarter since '87 crash limps to a close for dow and sp, worst quarter since '87 3rd quarter worst for stocks since '87 (denver post) market's tumble persists, capping worst three months in 15 years stock market quarterly review (paid subscription required.) beware! october is a very bad month for the stock market susan tompor bad news is, the beating isn't over yet  advertisement  what's really going on at microsoft? mary jo foley delivers unmatched reporting and insight with microsoft watch. track initiatives like .net, palladium, longhorn, trinity, yukon release dates, competitive moves, people. for a free 14day trial subscription  winnick handsoff or redhanded?  former global crossing chairman gary winnick will appear before a congressional committee today. it won't be pretty. cnn predicted he will plead the fifth. most other outlets expected winnick to testify. impetus for all the coverage was yesterday's release by the house energy and commerce committee of memos indicating that winnick was in the thick of the company's suspect dealmaking. a committee spokesman said, ""if he tries to portray himself as an outoftheloop ceremonial chairman, we intend to remind him that he is under oath."" the memo that got most of the attention was one from thenceo leo hindery to winnick in june 2001. hindery warned in colorful language that the company was heading for a fall. the financial times, washington post, and new york times all ran a quote from the memo comparing telcos to salmon. hindery urged winnick to unload the company  ""without looking like we are shaking our bootie all over the world,"" quoted the two timeses  and resigned shortly thereafter. one little detail from the memos is guaranteed to make winnick's time under the television lights even more uncomfortable. among the companies he used his influence with, to help close deals, was enron. all the reports mentioned enron, but the new york times seemed to be alone in noting that global crossing never completed a deal with the fallen energy giant. the wall street journal looked beyond the obviously embarrassing details of the memos to point out that, despite such evidence, the gun might not be smoking yet. ""prosecutors would still need to prove that he knew the transactions were improper and used them mainly as a way of enriching himself by boosting the company's stock price artificially,"" the journal reporters wrote. the ap noted that all of the memos were dated after winnick's last sale of global crossing stock, $123 million in may 2001. despite his $734 million in stock profits, gary winnick was not among the five telco executives being sued by new york attorney general eliot spitzer to return their illgotten gains. is spitzer betting, with the journal, that winnick might walk away clean?  keith dawson global crossing what did winnick know? winnick was told of telecom risks memo indicates global crossing chief knew of troubles global crossing's winnick knew about swap deals (paid subscription required) documents show active role by global crossing chairman (ap) suit seeks ipo profits from five executives  other stories  fund giant fidelity set to eliminate 1,695 jobs (boston globe) aol chairman's no. 1 ally turns into his biggest foe more living without benefits health insurance given less frequently at work beware alqaida, branch is on to you (battle creek enquirer) hewlettpackard and emc sue each other (reuters) dealing with w broadband disconnect judge dismisses $800m cell phonebrain tumor suit (ap) microsoft puts meat behind security push  do you want to reach the net's savviest audience? advertise in media unspun. contact erik vanderkolk for details at today.  staff  written by deborah asbrand keith dawson jen muehlbauer and lori patel copyedited by jim duffy marketing cowpoke productions (cowpokeproductions.com). advertising erik vanderkolk editor and publisher jimmy guterman media unspun is produced by the vineyard group inc. copyright 2002 media unspun, inc., and the vineyard group, inc. subscribe already, willya? redistribution by email is permitted as long as a link to is included.  powered by to be removed from this list, use this link to receive future messages in html format, use this link to change your subscriber information, use this link","['http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A24961-2002Sep30.html', 'mailto:jimduffy86@yahoo.com', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/01/business/01GLOB.html', 'http://www.freep.com/money/business/insure30_20020930.htm', '#a97667', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A24921-2002Sep30.html', 'mailto:dawson@world.std.com', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/change.cfm?x=mediaunspun%2Czzz-unspun@example.com%2Ctxt', 'http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/technology/tech-tech-hewlett-emc.html', 'http://guterman.com', 'http://www.imakenews.com/affiliate.cfm?a_id=unspun', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/01/business/01STOX.html', 'http://www.nypost.com/business/58389.htm', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/01/opinion/01KRUG.html', 'mailto:dasbrand@world.std.com', 'mailto:guterman@vineyard.com', 'http://newsletter.mediaunspun.com', 'http://www.freep.com/money/business/tompor1_20021001.htm', 'http://www.usatoday.com/money/markets/us/2002-09-30-bear-bottom_x.htm', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/update.cfm?x=mediaunspun%2Czzz-unspun@example.com', 'http://www.thestreet.com/markets/aarontaskfree/10045171.html', 'http://www.imakenews.com', 'https://ziffdavis.omeda.com/zm/msw/msw.cgi?intro2&p=5UCXA00075', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A22712-2002Sep30.html', 'http://www.mediaunspun.com/subscribe.html', 'http://tinyurl.com/1q3i', 'http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1033426396710785953,00.html', 'http://tinyurl.com/1prs', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/remove.cfm?x=mediaunspun%2Czzz-unspun@example.com', 'http://www.msnbc.com/news/534548.asp', '#a97669', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/01/technology/01AOL.html', 'mailto:jen@englishmajor.com', 'http://www.nydailynews.com/business/story/23183p-21985c.html', 'http://online.wsj.com/page/0,,2_0861,00.html', 'mailto:loripatel@hotmail.com', 'http://www.cowpokeproductions.com', 'http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/business/4187381.htm', 'http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,561985,00.asp', '#a97668', 'http://www.poptech.org', 'http://tinyurl.com/1q3h', 'http://www.mediaunspun.com', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/mod_input_proc.cfm?mod_name=tell_friend_form&XXDESXXuser=mediaunspun&XXDESXXthanks=Thank%20You%2E&XXDESXXsubject=Check%20this%20out%3A%20%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D&XXDESXXheading=&XXDESXXbackto=http://newsletter.mediaunspun.com/index000021074.cfm&XXDESXXissue_id=21074&XXDESXXtitle=Media%20Unspun', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A24886-2002Sep30.html', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21649-2002Sep30.html', 'http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4186771.htm', 'mailto:erikvanderkolk@yahoo.com', 'http://www.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/09/30/time.crossing.tm/']",11015,49,0,hard_ham_testing

""politics,"" is what i have been told. too ""populist"" for the new elite who now sit in judgment of what is art. ""they don't want to help further your platform mike,"" a person close to the committee tells me. ""one of them even said, 'i know this film is going to be popular  and i don't personally want to contribute to its popularity.'"" so, it was decided that ""bowling for columbine,"" a cannes prizewinner, knighted by the chicago tribune as ""one of the most effective politicalpolemical films ever,"" a film chosen by every single film festival around the world this fall  no, this film must not be shown at lincoln center just six blocks from the edit room where we made it... 77 blocks north of ground zero. i've gone too far this time, cut too close to the bone, stuck my lens where it doesn't belong  right straight through the heart of an america that is both master and victim of the ultraviolence. it is so sad to see this place where i will always remember my mother taking that bow now cowering to the whims of neos who, like their counterparts in hollywood, preside over the demolition of a once great art form.        my dad drops me off and goes to park in the shortterm lot. he comes inside just as the airport personnel are taking everything out of my suitcase for inspection. they don't ask to see the print of the film, the only thing i might have had on me that is poised to do any real damage (to all the right people, of course). my dad and i stop short of the metal detectors and the next round of inspectors who are anxious to look at my smelly feet. we hug, and he kisses me, and i am trying hard, so very hard, to not break down in the middle of this airport. he tells me not to worry about him, and i tell him i'll call him from detroit when i am changing planes. i go through security and as i am being taken aside to be searched again, i look back and see him still standing there, watching out for me. my dad. i'm on the plane and i'm thirsty, but i took the water bottle out of my bag when i packed it this morning. the bottle, halfdrank, had been sitting untouched in my untouched bag since i stuck it in there the night we had to rush my mom to the hospital. the bottle was still there in that overnight bag where i put my tshirt and sweatpants, the ones i had on for the night and day i sat by my mother's side in the hospital as she struggled to live, holding her hand, holding her head, trying to comfort her, strands of hair on my sweater. i can see the stains from where my tears and mucus ran uncontrollably down my face and onto that sweater. the doctor said she had an 80% chance of making it. an hour before she died, another doctor said the chances were 1 in 100. that was good enough for me. one in one hundred! i've had those odds! i won! don't let her die! please do everything you can do! don't let her die. the priest came, then another priest came, and when the priests left my dad asked us three kids and the three grandkids to all join hands and say our goodbyes to mom, say whatever we wanted to about what she meant to us. (i am sorry... i cannot complete this paragraph right now, i can't see the screen through the tears...maybe someday...) the night before we rushed her to the hospital i had a little surprise planned for her. i had brought a copy of my new movie and i was going to show it to her. as the end credits would roll, she would get to see what she has seen at the end of all of my work her name along with my dad's in that list of credits...and, to me, it's the only real credit that ever mattered  because without them i would not have the life they gave me, the way they raised me... it is all a privilege i will never cease being thankful for. i never got to show her the movie that night. ""mike!"" she called out from the porch, in a pitch of voice i had never heard. ""get your father! i don't feel good."" she was, without warning, dying. within 48 hours she would be gone.       i'm walking through the detroit airport to gate 75 for the flight to denver, and i hear someone say, ""ok, mr. stuckup, just walk right on by!"" i turn to see it is one of anchors from the local tv station in flint. i apologize. my sunglasses are on. i have been crying since i left my dad at the flint airport. i explain this to her and she starts to get tears in her eyes. ""my mom died in october,"" she says, and i realize that this pain that feels so solitary is, truthfully, a shared experience amongst us all. no one is immune from this loss. but instead of taking the time to tell me about how rough it has been for her, she asks about how i am doing and how is my dad doing and did we get the flowers she and the others sent. she gives me her number and says to call anytime if i feel the need to talk. at that moment i remember what she told me  that her mother also died this year and i think, man, get over yourself, mike, you are not alone in this, and so i ask her how she is doing. ""i think a lot,"" she says, ""about all the things she won't see my two children grow up to do, to be. but i believe she is in my heart, right here, right now, and she will see it all."" they call my flight and i rush over to the payphone to call my dad to see if he got home ok. he tells me that when he left the short term lot he got talking to the person in the tollbooth who told him about her mother getting cancer and how she was caring for her. ""she said that her bill in the hospital came to $60,000,"" he says with astonishment. ""they won't be able to pay it. she makes six dollars an hour, no health insurance. i gave her a tip along with the toll."" ""you gave the tollbooth worker a tip?"" ""well, you have to. that person could be you or me."" that is my father. that was my mother. yours, michael moore ps. thank you, all of you, who sent me your condolences and who contributed to the local poverty program in my mother's name. i was so moved by your generosity and by your words of love and kindness. it will never be forgotten.  if you wish to be be unsubscribed from this mailing list, please click the link below and follow the instructions.",[],10825,0,0,hard_ham_testing

Advisory CA-2002-21 Vulnerability in PHP,cert advisory ca200221 vulnerability in php,"begin pgp signed message cert advisory ca200221 vulnerability in php original release date july 22, 2002 last revised  source certcc a complete revision history can be found at the end of this file. systems affected  systems running php versions 4.2.0 or 4.2.1 overview a vulnerability has been discovered in php. this vulnerability could be used by a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or crash php andor the web server. i. description php is a popular scripting language in widespread use. for more information about php, see the vulnerability occurs in the portion of php code responsible for handling file uploads, specifically multipartformdata. by sending a specially crafted post request to the web server, an attacker can corrupt the internal data structures used by php. specifically, an intruder can cause an improperly initialized memory structure to be freed. in most cases, an intruder can use this flaw to crash php or the web server. under some circumstances, an intruder may be able to take advantage of this flaw to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the web server. you may be aware that freeing memory at inappropriate times in some implementations of malloc and free does not usually result in the execution of arbitrary code. however, because php utilizes its own memory management system, the implementation of malloc and free is irrelevant to this problem. stefan esser of ematters gmbh has indicated that intruders cannot execute code on x86 systems. however, we encourage system administrators to apply patches on x86 systems as well to guard against denialofservice attacks and asyetunknown attack techniques that may permit the execution of code on x86 architectures. this vulnerability was discovered by ematters gmbh and is described in detail in their advisory. the php group has also issued an advisory. a list of vendors contacted by the certcc and their status regarding this vulnerability is available in vu929115. although this vulnerability only affects php 4.2.0 and 4.2.1, ematters gmbh has previously identified vulnerabilities in older versions of php. if you are running older versions of php, we encourage you to review ii. impact a remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on a vulnerable system. an attacker may not be able to execute code on x86 architectures due to the way the stack is structured. however, an attacker can leverage this vulnerability to crash php andor the web server running on an x86 architecture. iii. solution apply a patch from your vendor appendix a contains information provided by vendors for this advisory. as vendors report new information to the certcc, we will update this section and note the changes in our revision history. if a particular vendor is not listed below, we have not received their comments. please contact your vendor directly. upgrade to the latest version of php if a patch is not available from your vendor, upgrade to version 4.2.2. deny post requests until patches or an update can be applied, you may wish to deny post requests. the following workaround is taken from the php security advisory if the php applications on an affected web server do not rely on http post input from user agents, it is often possible to deny post requests on the web server. in the apache web server, for example, this is possible with the following code included in the main configuration file or a toplevel .htaccess file limit post order deny,allow deny from all limit note that an existing configuration andor .htaccess file may have parameters contradicting the example given above. disable vulnerable service until you can upgrade or apply patches, you may wish to disable php. as a best practice, the certcc recommends disabling all services that are not explicitly required. before deciding to disable php, carefully consider your service requirements. appendix a.  vendor information this appendix contains information provided by vendors for this advisory. as vendors report new information to the certcc, we will update this section and note the changes in our revision history. if a particular vendor is not listed below, we have not received their comments. apple computer inc. mac os x and mac os x server are shipping with php version 4.1.2 which does not contain

the umbrella stand? the theatrics that make the corporate crime beat great? we're kidding (mostly), but that could be why overseas outlets barely noticed this comparatively tame example of american excess. the journal had one amusing tidbit, though after keller got fired, aol vice chairman ted leonsis hired him as a consultant for the hockey team the washington capitals, of which leonsis is the majority owner. leonsis said he let keller go after finding out why he lost his aol job, but keller still picked up his capitals phone as of wednesday. as outrageous severance packages go, it's no jack welshge $9 million annual pension, but it'll have to do.  jen muehlbauer homestore executives agree to guilty pleas homestore, aol ad deals yield guilty pleas (usa today) u.s. focuses on executive at homestore homestore's exexecs to aid investigators probe of homestore turns to an exaol executive (paid registration required.) jack welch's very golden years glengarry glen ross  advertisement  what's really going on at microsoft?

the media can't figure it out. can ceo jeanrene fourtou? his fuzziness at yesterday's board meeting got reporters to wondering. if he can't explain his vision, does that mean he's lacking the 2020 clarity that observers on two continents were banking on? for fourtou, worse than the monsieur magoo accusations are the comparisons, starting to bubble through media accounts, that he resembles  wait, we're rubbing our eyes  the vilified jeanmarie messier. media watchers can rate reporters' confusion over fourtou's latest pronouncements by tallying the amount of space outlets devoted to their coverage of the mess. the new york times ran 24 paragraphs on the board meeting  and then filed another 19 in an analysis that sought to examine what the latest moves meant. the financial times posted two articles on the meeting and still had more to say, lambasting fourtou in lex, the peach paper's influential column. lex called the exec's update ""more like a rambling fireside chat ... than a strategy presentation."" there's little that's clear about what's ahead for vivendi. the company now says that it will dispose of 12 billion euros worth of assets over the next 18 months. here's how reporters examining the tea leaves read the current plan out are telepiu, an italian paytv operation, and canal plus technologies, a maker of settop boxes. on the way out are vivendi's publishing properties, which include houghton mifflin, and a minority stake in a pc gamemaker. that leaves vivendi's stake in telecom, via its cegetel investment, and its universal entertainment properties, and  hey, wait a minute, wasn't that messier's plan, the new york times wondered by way of an analyst's quote. to confuse matters further, news corp., the alleged partner in the done deal for telepiu, says no deal is in place, according to the financial times. as for cegetel, fourtou said he'd consider selling vivendi's 44% stake then again, maybe he'll increase it. and that was all in one postmeeting telephone conference. the only decision by vivendi in which fourtou seemed sure was his claim that the company won't pay any severance to messier. ""he enjoyed making deals too much and overpaid,"" the guardian quoted fourtou as saying, and then adding, ""this all went to his head."" with heads other than messier's now in question, is vivendi's viability again in doubt? outlets today report that enron's logo, the oversize capital ""e"" that stood outside its headquarters, sold at auction for $44,000. how many euros might a v bring?  deborah asbrand vivendi will move quickly to sell many assets what's new at vivendi? depends who's talking vivendi in move to sell raft of assets (financial times) vivendi board to deny messier severance pay (financial times) lex vivendi universal (financial times) news corp counters report of telepiu sale (financial times) vivendi aims to realise eu12bn from asset sales (daily telegraph) messier 'won't get a penny' vivendi shakes up board, denies messier's severance enron auctions off furniture and famous 'e'  other stories  hp boosts layoffs by 1,800 former worldcom controller to plead guilty to two counts (wall street journal) tyco rewarded an executive during a grand jury inquiry bell labs researcher falsified experiments (ap) germany's neuer markt to close resources dry up as joblessness drags on (usa today) merrill aide to plead guilty (wall street journal) enron excfo clears his throat for feds music labels seek piracy payback  do you want to reach the net's savviest audience? advertise in media unspun. contact erik vanderkolk for details at today.  staff  written by deborah asbrand keith dawson jen muehlbauer and lori patel copyedited by jim duffy advertising erik vanderkolk editor and publisher jimmy guterman media unspun is produced by the vineyard group inc. copyright 2002 media unspun, inc., and the vineyard group, inc. subscribe already, willya? redistribution by email is permitted as long as a link to is included.  powered by to be removed from this list, use this link to receive future messages in html format, use this link to change your subscriber information, use this link","['http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/business/26ENRO.html', 'mailto:jimduffy86@yahoo.com', 'http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/tech/news/1591103', 'http://www.fool.com/news/Take/2002/mft/mft02090903.htm', 'http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-napster26sep26001431,0,388519.story', 'http://tinyurl.com/1ncs', '#a96666', 'mailto:dawson@world.std.com', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/change.cfm?x=mediaunspun%2Czzz-unspun@example.com%2Ctxt', 'http://guterman.com', 'http://tinyurl.com/1ncq', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/mod_input_proc.cfm?mod_name=tell_friend_form&XXDESXXuser=mediaunspun&XXDESXXthanks=Thank%20You%2E&XXDESXXsubject=Check%20this%20out%3A%20%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D&XXDESXXheading=&XXDESXXbackto=http://newsletter.mediaunspun.com/index000020868.cfm&XXDESXXissue_id=20868&XXDESXXtitle=Media%20Unspun', 'http://tinyurl.com/1ncw', '#a96667', 'http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-vivendi26sep26,0,481695.story', 'http://www.imakenews.com/affiliate.cfm?a_id=unspun', 'http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1032971619118707713,00.html', 'http://media.guardian.co.uk/city/story/0,7497,799283,00.html', 'mailto:dasbrand@world.std.com', 'mailto:guterman@vineyard.com', 'http://newsletter.mediaunspun.com', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/technology/26AOL.html', 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2283068.stm', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/update.cfm?x=mediaunspun%2Czzz-unspun@example.com', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/business/26PLAC.html', 'http://www.imakenews.com', 'https://ziffdavis.omeda.com/zm/msw/msw.cgi?intro2&p=5UCXA00075', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3165-2002Sep25.html', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/business/26VIVE.html', 'http://www.mediaunspun.com/subscribe.html', 'http://tinyurl.com/1nc1', 'http://tinyurl.com/1nd0', 'http://www.nypost.com/business/57905.htm', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/remove.cfm?x=mediaunspun%2Czzz-unspun@example.com', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/business/26PAY.html', 'mailto:jen@englishmajor.com', 'mailto:loripatel@hotmail.com', 'http://www.cowpokeproductions.com', '#a96668', 'http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-homestore26sep26,0,5107257.story', 'http://www.poptech.org', 'http://www.mediaunspun.com', 'http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4151819.htm', 'http://www.msnbc.com/news/813048.asp', 'http://www.msnbc.com/news/813195.asp?0dm=B21AB', 'mailto:erikvanderkolk@yahoo.com', 'http://us.imdb.com/Title?0104348', 'http://tinyurl.com/1nbz', 'http://tinyurl.com/1ncy']",11695,49,0,hard_ham_testing

never got mentioned that lockergnome has a gnometome for all you dreamweaver users out there. dennis jarrett, a gnomie from the uk with a prolific list of writing accomplishments, lent his brain to a list of things everyone should know to make using dreamweaver 4 (and newer) easier to use. i 've never actually used version 4, having stuck with 3 until recently starting the review process of the studiomx suite, but i've been able to apply every tip i tried to some aspect of dreamweavermx, so i can only guess those of you using 4 will want to check 'em out too . as i mentioned in yesterday's digital media newsletter, i recently switched cell phones to the kyocera qcp6035 . the unit is palm powered, with a screen the size of an m105 and all the functionality of palm os, in addition to having the latest bells and whistles you'd want in a phone. built in web browsing, by way of msn, is slightly cumbersome compared to what i'm used to from my cable connection, but i can already see the usefulness in carrying around portable access to things like driving directions. now that i've got a way to test the final results in real time, i've got a more vested interest in making lockergnome considerably more wap compatible. i'm still figuring out many of the phone's features, so that's still going to be at least a few weeks away. without a doubt, i'll be sharing my experiences in waping lockergnome in an upcoming series of articles. jake ludington gnomemail phpmynewsletter as a free solution for managing newsletters, for smaller lists, this does most of what you need. subscribers are stored in a mysql database, with the ability to send user confirmation emails. initially, the address must still be added manually to the database, which isn't idea, but doing this generates a confirmation email with a link that users click on if they want to be added. the software purges addresses with no response, following an administrator defined waiting period. from the php interface you can send either text or html formatted messages, with a builtin preview to make sure your formatting is ok. documentation is somewhat sparse, so prior knowledge of php and mysql are useful in getting this installed. gnometools opalisrobot v4.0 60mb ntw2kxp think of this as something like ""cron for windows"" only even more powerful. opalisrobot allows you to schedule almost any process on your server, adding an additional layer of functionality, like the ability to program telephony commands to complete administrative tasks. opalisrobot effectively processes email commands, in addition to telephone dtmf tones, making everything on your server administerable from remote locations, even when you can't get remote control access of the machine. programming jobs is pointclick simple, saving you time even when you schedule tasks to save you time. if you operate in a windows server environment, you're adding extra hours to your day and costing your company additional dollars by not having this software. gnomeserver png files do not show transparency in internet explorer (q294714) ""if you browse to a web page that contains an image that has a transparent background in portable network graphics (png) format, the image background may appear to be gray rather than transparent."" fortunately, microsoft explains a solution for this problem. personally, i haven't encountered this png display error, but for those of you simplementing pngs on your sites, you'll want to review the solution. web templates with css cut your design costs and

blog accessibility, it happens to be equally relevant for any site. the 30 days are nearing their end, which means you won't have to wait to find out what's next you can simply click to the next page. mark pilgrim, the site's creator, sets the stage with 5 characters (all of which could easily represent real people) and walks through their physical, mental, and technological limitations. following the character introductions, mark walks through an accessibility scenario each day and then relates the concept back specific benefits for each character's limitations. solutions are presented with blogs in mind, but with very little extrapolation you'll be able to make every site you design more user friendly. gnomeblog backend.userland.com i've been using radio from the moment i finally got around to creating a blog. the software keeps things simple and automatically updates itself when new things get added. userland goes far beyond creating a desktop interface for their blogging system though. they've fully documented all the xml, xmlrpc, and soap tieins used to connect to their network, which could easily be adapted to other content management applications with some xml knowhow. backend is the place to look ""under the hood"" at userland's xml inner workings, including detailed documentation on making everything work. if you've got modifications or improvements to the system,

i wouldn't want anyone to invade my privacy with that sort of camera setup. coincidentally, i ran across this interesting discussion about this in the boards, where members were discussing these miniature cameras , called cctvs, and the privacy concerns around them. so if you want more info or would like to leave your two cents' worth about this, send us a post. besides, this information might keep you from getting caught on camera in an embarrassing situation. lee koo cnet community got suggestions?

(we might eat these words tomorrow, but we doubt it.) in an unrelated confession, ibm gave the commission its latest layoff numbers. ibm talked about pink slips during its secondquarter earnings report, but with a vagueness worthy of your daily horoscope. (""capricorn career changes may be on their way..."") only after ""months of surreptitious layoff notices"" did the company admit that it's cutting more than 15,600 jobs, said the ap. that's about 5% of its workforce, and a lot more than pundits expected. an ibm spokesperson told the wall street journal the higher number was due to ""rebalancing"" and more employees than expected taking voluntary layoffs. sorry, we're still back on ""rebalancing."" did ibm ""rightsize"" last quarter, too? ibm's news was still trickling out wednesday morning, but some details were available. about 1,400 workers got cut from ibm's microelectronics unit, and most of the rest were from it services and consulting.

""los angeles times"", aug. 2002 a unbacked study released on friday said the ""asian brown cloud""  a vast haze of pollution stretching across south asia  is damaging agriculture, modifying rainfall patterns and endangering the population. ""agence france presse"", aug. 2002 3. weird words pyknic 'piknik  short and fat. nothing to do with alfresco meals, though it is said the same way as ""picnic"". in the early years of the twentieth century the german psychiatrist ernst kretschmer examined criminals to try to tie their physical shape and constitution to their personalities and mental illnesses. tall and thin ones he called ""asthenic"" (or ""leptosomic"") and considered them to be the sort that commits fraud and petty theft. a second set were athletic types with welldeveloped muscles, whom he concluded, unsurprisingly, were more likely to be violent. the third sort were the ""pyknic"" ones, who seemed to be a mixture of the other two kinds so far as their criminal tendencies were concerned. he took ""pyknic"" from greek ""puknos"", thick or close packed it appeared first in his book ""krperbau und charakter"" (physique and character) in 1921, from where it soon moved into english. the american psychologist william sheldon built on and modified kretschmer's ideas, coming up with the three terms to describe body types  ""endomorph"", ""mesomorph"" and ""ectomorph""  that are now more common. he considered kretschmer's pyknic type to be a mixture of the endomorph (with a soft round body tending to put on fat, the santa claus type) and the mesomorph (with a compact, powerful, and athletic body tending to the tarzan or mr universe type) and came up with the phrase ""pyknic practical joke"" to describe a person who is muscular in early life but who later goes pearshaped and balloons out into obesity. 4. qa  q. a friend and i were reading a recent article in the ""new york times"" that made mention of a ""mash note"". i had never heard this term before, but i extrapolated that it is some sort of love note. is there a more specific meaning than a simple love note? and can you give some insight as to the origin of the term? jane rosenthal, california a. you're right about the meaning of the phrase. we have to go back some way to find the origin. the first form was the word ""mash"" by itself. this was a slang term in the us in the 1870s for an infatuation or crush (a magazine in 1877 defined it as ""a deep but fleeting affection of the heart""). a ""mash"" could also be a dandy or the object of one's affection (of either sex) or  as a verb  to make amorous advances to a member of the opposite sex, to flirt or seduce. a ""masher"" was a man who thought himself irresistible to the female sex but whose advances were often unwelcome. the evidence collected by professor lighter in the ""random house historical dictionary of american slang"" and by others suggests that it was originally a term used in and around the theatre. charles godfrey leland (best known for his ""hans breitmanns ballads"" about a german immigrant) wrote a note above his poem, ""the masher"", dated about 1895, confirming this the word to ""mash,"" in the sense of causing love or attracting by a glance or fascinating look, came into ordinary slang from the american stage. thus an actress was often fined for ""mashing"" or smiling at men in the audience. ""mash"" and its derivatives crossed the atlantic to britain about 1880. ""masher"" in particular became a term in london society, especially among the more raffish supperclub and theatregoing classes, for a type of fashionable male. the oxford english dictionary defines it (with a distinctly maidenly air of drawing away its collective skirts) as ""a fop of affected manners and exaggerated style of dress who frequented musichalls and fashionable promenades and who posed as a 'ladykiller'"", noting that the word had been common ""in 1882 and for a few years after"". in a letter from london in the old ""overland monthly and out west magazine"" in 1889, a correspondent described a member of an impoverished theatrical company ""this dashing youth was distinctly conscious of his fascinations for the buxom maids who sighed beside us, and the airy and elegant nonchalance of the glances that superbly took them in would be a lesson for champion 'mashers' of a far higher class"". a ""mash note"" (in its first appearances, ""mash letter"") was an obvious enough extension a love letter. it is recorded first in 1880 and  as you have discovered  is still doing well. where ""mash"" and its relatives come from has been a subject of debate. it is sometimes said that it is from the standard english word meaning to make soft by one of various means, with its obvious reference to rendering the object of one's attentions pliable and yielding. max beerbohm, writing in london in 1894 (mashers were still around then, despite the oed's comment) remarked that some people derived it from ""ma chre"", ""the mode of address used by the gilded youth to the barmaids of the period"". but he thought it really came from ""the chorus of a song, which, at that time, had a great vogue in the musichalls 'i'm the slashing, dashing, mashing montmorency of the day.'"" we're pretty sure now that he was wrong, but he could hardly know that. back to charles leland again. apart from his humorous writings, he also researched and wrote a great deal about the romany language as well as gypsy songs and customs. the following note from the introduction to the poem gives an origin that is now widely accepted it was introduced by the wellknown gypsy family of actors, c., among whom romany was habitually spoken. the word ""masher"" or ""mash"" means in that tongue to allure, delude, or entice. it was doubtless much aided in its popularity by its quasiidentity with the english word. but there can be no doubt as to the gypsy origin of ""mash"" as used on the stage. i am indebted for this information to the late well known impresario palmer of new york, and i made a note of it years before the term had become at all popular. though defunct in british english, ""mash"" and ""masher"" have never quite gone away in america. ""mash"" had a resurgence of popularity as student slang in the 1980s in the sense of necking or petting, though that may be a backformation from ""mash note"". 5. endnote  ""a spanish lady asked an acquaintance during a visit to ireland whether there was a word in his language similar to 'manaa'. the irishman thought for a moment, then said 'sure there is, but it doesn't have the same sense of urgency.'"" traditional irish joke. a. subscription commands  to leave the list, change your subscription address, or subscribe, please visit  or, you can send a message to from the address at which you are (or want to be) subscribed to leave, send signoff worldwidewords to join, send subscribe worldwidewords firstname lastname b. contact addresses  do not use the address that comes up when you hit 'reply' on this mailing, or your message will be sent to an electronic deadletter office. either create a new message, or change the outgoing 'to' address to one of these for general comments, especially responses to qa pieces for questions intended for reply in a future qa feature  world wide words is copyright (c) michael quinion 2002. all rights reserved. the words web site is at   you may reproduce this newsletter in whole or in part in other free media online provided that you include this note and the copyright notice above. reproduction in print media or on web sites requires prior permission contact",[],12779,0,0,hard_ham_testing

office, and i figure it's going to be a piece of cake. he recently acquired a new phone through verizon along with web access and a tie into his aol mailbox, which was the driving force behind this request. what i found was that internet email proved to be easy using a simple forwarding rule, but none of the internal exchange email was being sent out to the internet upon receipt, even though it appeared to be included in the rule. as it happens, this is due to a default configuration option on the exchange 5.5 server that prevents automatic repliesforwards from being sent to the internet

checker as a possible solution to my windows media player problem under windows xp, and i did indeed run through it prior to attempting an inplace upgrade, obviously with no improvement. it's still worth a mention, however, in case you're not familiar with what it's there for. as you're probably aware, xp contains a file protection scheme that will immediate replace any system files that are deleted or altered in any way, ensuring that xp is kept in a stable state. sometimes this system can get a little out of whack, and the sfc is meant to restore order. note that any hotfixes and other microsoftprovided updates will be left in place since they properly update the dll cache that is used as the sanity check to determine if a system file has been messed with. to access the sfc, simply launch a command prompt and type ""sfc"" to display a list of options. gnomestuff consider this forwarded by jw the next time you have a facetoface with your elected representatives, you might want to

remember, this is a place where a bandana hanging on a string across an otherwise public road will close it down until the local erstcannibal huntergatherer turned statutorilypermanent landowner figures out just what his new or imagined property rights are this afternoon. the point is, any cypherpunk worth his salt will tell you that only solution to financial or any other, privacy, is to make private transactions on the net, cheaper, and more secure, than ""transparent"" transactions currently are in meatspace. then things get real interesting, and financial privacy  and considerably more personal freedom  will just be the icing on the wedding cake. bride and groom action figures sold separately, of course. cheers, rah (who went to fc2k at the grand cayman marriott in february that year. nice place, i liked anguilla better though, at least at the time, and i haven't been back to either since. the beaches are certainly better in anguilla, and the ""private"" banking system there is probably just as porous as cayman's is, by this point. if i were to pick up and move somewhere free outside your friendly neighborhood unipolar superpower, new zealand is somewhere near the top of my list, and chile would be next, though things change quickly out there in ballisticmissile flyover country. in that vein, who knows, maybe we're in for some kind of latterday peloponnesian irony, and russia will end up the freest place on earth someday. stranger things have happened in the last couple of decades, yes?) begin pgp signature version pgp 7.5 iqaawubpvys48pxh8jf3ohaeqkwtgcgwxswzauabep8jdvuvkrgfdroan0xf owk90gokx5pvbgokxcwzbk 1w9d end pgp signature   r. a. hettinga mailto the internet bearer underwriting corporation  44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa ""... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, predicting the end of the world has not been found agreeable to experience.""  edward gibbon, 'decline and fall of the roman empire'",[],6289,0,0,hard_ham_testing

internet recruiting online branding to share or not to share scribbled by lee smith i think that online file sharing is dependent on the file that is being shared. if the song is a current release or recent, then i do not believe in it. i can't consider it stealing because you can't steal from someone who willingly puts the file up for downloading. those who did put the file online most likely feel that it is also not stealing, since they purchased the cd. however, i do not agree with riaa or recording companies who are attempting to make their cds ""rip proof"" either. i do not feel they have the right to dictate what songs i can listen to or when or in what order. i like to rip specific songs from cds then make my own cd, which either goes down to my entertainment system or to my truck. the master cd is saved and rarely played (""why"" is explained later in this message). i prefer making my own cds for my truck because if my truck were to be broken into and my cds stolen, it would be much easier to replace a selfburned cd than a master. sometimes, masters cannot be replaced without a large expense, if at all. if the song is outdated, an oldie (so to speak), and is not available anywhere, then yes, i do believe in it. or, if the song being sought is wanted to rejuvenate one's collection, then yes, i do believe in that, too. case in point as a kid, i collected a lot of 45s and record albums. i have more than 4,000 records in my collection. many were played so much that they are not playable anymore and, even though i did take care of them, due to the cheap stereos and record players in the 60s, they are 'shot.' i want to relive some of my younger days through music, but attempting to convert those records (to digital) is next to impossible for me. so, in this instance, no, i do not think it is illegal to seek out digitalized copies of the old songs that i already have records of (albums andor 45s). if, however, the song(s) that i am seeking are available on cd, then i will be very quick to purchase that cd from tower records, the warehouse, or any other reputable dealer. for those that are impossible to find ""digitals"" for, then, one day, perhaps i will reach a point with technology (and money) where i can transfer those platters to wav and they will sound as good as when they were originally recorded. i have been lucky enough to find some on cd thanks to the internet i was quick to purchase the disc, usually from the original artists themselves. some of the music that i have, sadly, will never be heard again. i blame riaa and the recording industry for that, too. neither seem to care about the ""lost"" songs when digitally remastered cds are released. submit your thoughts  recommend it! chris teaches the basics if you've got

getting a dv camera. i got one about a month ago, and i made one mistake i didn't get one with av inputs. mine has av outputs, which are great for getting your digital stuff out onto vhs, etc. but without the inputs, there's no way to get vhs or old 8mm footage into the camera. with inputs, not only can you get your old 8mm  vhs stuff onto dv tapes, but you can use the camera as a passthrough device and get the old stuff directly onto your computer for editing purposes. i wish someone had made clear the advantages and importance of inputs when i bought my dv camcorder. the reviews and magazines i read barely mentioned this feature  and nobody stressed its importance. but if you're going to be doing any editing, it is critical (if you want to work on any of your old stuff). don't make the same mistake i did  make sure you get this feature. it doesn't seem to impact the price of the cameras some offer it and some don't."" this advice came not a moment too soon for me. thank you

""3rd quarter worst for stocks since '87,"" read the denver post, repeating a popular figure reached by tallying the dow and sp's percentage losses. the new york daily news counted percentage losses for the month only and declared it the worst september since 1937. everyone predicted a lousy september 2002, so the phrase ""selffulfilling prophecy"" does spring to mind. so does the phrase ""gloom and doom."" ""every day for the last three months, the market has erased $73 of wealth, including saturdays, sundays and holidays, for every person living in the united states,"" said the san jose mercury news. ""countless investors are starting to wonder if stocks will ever go up again,"" wrote usa today. in a more plausible statement, thestreet.com's aaron task said recent declines ""demonstrated once again the folly of investors' repeated attempts to pinpoint a bottom"" and ""disabuse(d) them of the idea that the best time to buy is when things look worst, if only because recent history has shown stocks can go from terrible to awful and beyond."" ok, breathe. go read the comics or something. feeling better? good, because there's more. the new york post, in small enough words for everyone to understand, made the public service announcement ""beware! october is a very bad month for the stock market."" and you shouldn't take candy from strangers, either. the post's john crudele, a market curmudgeon before it was in style, warned, ""this market is very dangerous, even if things look like they couldn't get any worse."" detroit free press columnist susan tompor agreed that ""the next round of statements could indeed look pretty nasty."" we have to agree the stock market is bad. the economy is bad. it's going to get worse before it gets better, and that may take a while. the ""bottom"" is, technically, zero. be cautious, yes, but don't let the media's bipolar disorder ruin your day. just like dotcoms weren't really a new economy, a bear market isn't the end of the world.  jen muehlbauer no happy endings in september bear drags stocks deeply into den market's september is worst since 1937 dow posts worst month in 4 years market's worst quarter since '87 crash limps to a close for dow and sp, worst quarter since '87 3rd quarter worst for stocks since '87 (denver post) market's tumble persists, capping worst three months in 15 years stock market quarterly review (paid subscription required.) beware! october is a very bad month for the stock market susan tompor bad news is, the beating isn't over yet  advertisement  what's really going on at microsoft? mary jo foley delivers unmatched reporting and insight with microsoft watch. track initiatives like .net, palladium, longhorn, trinity, yukon release dates, competitive moves, people. for a free 14day trial subscription  winnick handsoff or redhanded?  former global crossing chairman gary winnick will appear before a congressional committee today. it won't be pretty. cnn predicted he will plead the fifth. most other outlets expected winnick to testify. impetus for all the coverage was yesterday's release by the house energy and commerce committee of memos indicating that winnick was in the thick of the company's suspect dealmaking. a committee spokesman said, ""if he tries to portray himself as an outoftheloop ceremonial chairman, we intend to remind him that he is under oath."" the memo that got most of the attention was one from thenceo leo hindery to winnick in june 2001. hindery warned in colorful language that the company was heading for a fall. the financial times, washington post, and new york times all ran a quote from the memo comparing telcos to salmon. hindery urged winnick to unload the company  ""without looking like we are shaking our bootie all over the world,"" quoted the two timeses  and resigned shortly thereafter. one little detail from the memos is guaranteed to make winnick's time under the television lights even more uncomfortable. among the companies he used his influence with, to help close deals, was enron. all the reports mentioned enron, but the new york times seemed to be alone in noting that global crossing never completed a deal with the fallen energy giant. the wall street journal looked beyond the obviously embarrassing details of the memos to point out that, despite such evidence, the gun might not be smoking yet. ""prosecutors would still need to prove that he knew the transactions were improper and used them mainly as a way of enriching himself by boosting the company's stock price artificially,"" the journal reporters wrote. the ap noted that all of the memos were dated after winnick's last sale of global crossing stock, $123 million in may 2001. despite his $734 million in stock profits, gary winnick was not among the five telco executives being sued by new york attorney general eliot spitzer to return their illgotten gains. is spitzer betting, with the journal, that winnick might walk away clean?  keith dawson global crossing what did winnick know? winnick was told of telecom risks memo indicates global crossing chief knew of troubles global crossing's winnick knew about swap deals (paid subscription required) documents show active role by global crossing chairman (ap) suit seeks ipo profits from five executives  other stories  fund giant fidelity set to eliminate 1,695 jobs (boston globe) aol chairman's no. 1 ally turns into his biggest foe more living without benefits health insurance given less frequently at work beware alqaida, branch is on to you (battle creek enquirer) hewlettpackard and emc sue each other (reuters) dealing with w broadband disconnect judge dismisses $800m cell phonebrain tumor suit (ap) microsoft puts meat behind security push  do you want to reach the net's savviest audience? advertise in media unspun. contact erik vanderkolk for details at today.  staff  written by deborah asbrand keith dawson jen muehlbauer and lori patel copyedited by jim duffy marketing cowpoke productions (cowpokeproductions.com). advertising erik vanderkolk editor and publisher jimmy guterman media unspun is produced by the vineyard group inc. copyright 2002 media unspun, inc., and the vineyard group, inc. subscribe already, willya? redistribution by email is permitted as long as a link to is included.  powered by to be removed from this list, use this link to receive future messages in html format, use this link to change your subscriber information, use this link","['http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A24961-2002Sep30.html', 'mailto:jimduffy86@yahoo.com', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/01/business/01GLOB.html', 'http://www.freep.com/money/business/insure30_20020930.htm', '#a97667', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A24921-2002Sep30.html', 'mailto:dawson@world.std.com', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/change.cfm?x=mediaunspun%2Czzz-unspun@example.com%2Ctxt', 'http://www.nytimes.com/reuters/technology/tech-tech-hewlett-emc.html', 'http://guterman.com', 'http://www.imakenews.com/affiliate.cfm?a_id=unspun', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/01/business/01STOX.html', 'http://www.nypost.com/business/58389.htm', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/01/opinion/01KRUG.html', 'mailto:dasbrand@world.std.com', 'mailto:guterman@vineyard.com', 'http://newsletter.mediaunspun.com', 'http://www.freep.com/money/business/tompor1_20021001.htm', 'http://www.usatoday.com/money/markets/us/2002-09-30-bear-bottom_x.htm', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/update.cfm?x=mediaunspun%2Czzz-unspun@example.com', 'http://www.thestreet.com/markets/aarontaskfree/10045171.html', 'http://www.imakenews.com', 'https://ziffdavis.omeda.com/zm/msw/msw.cgi?intro2&p=5UCXA00075', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A22712-2002Sep30.html', 'http://www.mediaunspun.com/subscribe.html', 'http://tinyurl.com/1q3i', 'http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1033426396710785953,00.html', 'http://tinyurl.com/1prs', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/remove.cfm?x=mediaunspun%2Czzz-unspun@example.com', 'http://www.msnbc.com/news/534548.asp', '#a97669', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/01/technology/01AOL.html', 'mailto:jen@englishmajor.com', 'http://www.nydailynews.com/business/story/23183p-21985c.html', 'http://online.wsj.com/page/0,,2_0861,00.html', 'mailto:loripatel@hotmail.com', 'http://www.cowpokeproductions.com', 'http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/business/4187381.htm', 'http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,3959,561985,00.asp', '#a97668', 'http://www.poptech.org', 'http://tinyurl.com/1q3h', 'http://www.mediaunspun.com', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/mod_input_proc.cfm?mod_name=tell_friend_form&XXDESXXuser=mediaunspun&XXDESXXthanks=Thank%20You%2E&XXDESXXsubject=Check%20this%20out%3A%20%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D&XXDESXXheading=&XXDESXXbackto=http://newsletter.mediaunspun.com/index000021074.cfm&XXDESXXissue_id=21074&XXDESXXtitle=Media%20Unspun', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A24886-2002Sep30.html', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A21649-2002Sep30.html', 'http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4186771.htm', 'mailto:erikvanderkolk@yahoo.com', 'http://www.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/09/30/time.crossing.tm/']",11015,49,0,hard_ham_testing

gnomewildcard full pdf books poor richard's web internet promotions email publishing web site makeover websites made easy online communities home networking internet recruiting online branding the evidence is against you scribbled by jim girard every time some new technology has expanded free access to popular music, starting with radio broadcasts of recorded songs in the 1930s, the recording industry has fought it  claiming that it would cost them money. and every time, it has resulted in increased sales. the bestknown example, of course, was the advances in tape cassette technology in the 60s and 70s, including dolby sound technology. as with mp3, this technology was opposed by the music industry as different from previous such developments, because it made it possible for ordinary people to create their own copies at nearprofessional quality. the actual result was the creation of a whole new profit center for the music industry  prerecorded cassette tapes  which actually became more popular than vinyl for a while (before the advent of cd technology). the thing is, the music industry is well aware of this effect  and they are not really aiming to stop the private exchange of songs in mp3 format. if that were their goal, they'd be instituting widespread, aggressive legal actions against all the servercentered nodes (as they did against all radio stations playing their music in the 30s, when they really thought the phenomenon was going to wipe them out). instead, they have focused on the bestknown services  first napster, then morpheus, kazaa, and most recently, audiogalaxy. even in those cases, they've limited their legal challenges to things they know they can win  and they've avoided actual court trials whenever possible (to avoid the possibility of setting some damaging precedent). the point that seems to escape a lot of people is that copyright is not a property in the same sense as most of the things we think of as property. one key difference is that if you don't defend it, you lose it. if you left your car sitting in the driveway, with the window open and the keys in the ignition, and somebody drove away in it, that would still be theft  and you'd still be entitled to get your car back. not so with copyright. if you are aware of infringement and you do nothing to try to stop it, you are voluntarily allowing it to enter the public domain. it's for the same reason that big companies insist that newspapers put a copyright or trademark symbol after the names of their products whenever they're mentioned, and not use words like ""coke"" or ""kleenex"" as generic terms. they don't really expect everybody to do what they say  and they're well aware that having the name of one's product become the generic term for a product is actually a great marketing boon. but if they don't do that, someone at some point could start using the word on their own product, arguing that it is in the public domain. the efforts of the music industry are not aimed at actually stopping the exchange of music between individuals  which they know from long experience, increases their sales because most of the people who normally buy the music aren't really satisfied with nearperfect copies. for most of them, the learning curve and the cost in time of creating those copies themselves outweighs the cost of simply buying the cd. most of the outright piracy is committed by people who wouldn't have bought the music in the first place. what the music industry is doing is clearly aimed at establishing a public record of their efforts to defend copyright, in the broadest, most public way to prevent anyone from making a legal claim that the stuff they own has entered the public domain. the thing they're really worried about, in terms of profits, is the change in the marketing model. even legitimate online music commerce threatens the album format, with its traditional mix of a few good songs and a bunch of others most people wouldn't pay for if they were buying the stuff song by song. the problem is how to make as much money on a persong basis  and, at the moment, it requires charging far more for an individual song that most people are willing to pay. at any rate, copyright is actually a fairly complex matter of civil law, with a good deal of history behind it  dating back to the renaissance. the strategies music companies use are clearly directed to realities and necessities, in light of history and case law. they have also done a great pr job, convincing the most technically knowledgeable people on the internet that it is a simple moral or criminal issue. ""common sense"" tells a lot of people that copying music without paying for it is just like stealing someone's car, and represents a loss to the owner. but if common sense could decide the issue equitably, we wouldn't have the law in the first place. most of our great intellectual systems, including not only law but science, are designed in large part to overcome the errors of common sense, and that is more the case in civil law than criminal. the people who work within those systems are well aware of that, but they are also well aware that most people aren't  and that it can work to their advantage. any time a highly paid civil attorney begins by telling you that an issue vital to his client is actually very simple, or just a matter of common sense, there's a very high probability that what he means is that it's to his clients advantage if people like you believe that. if it really were that simple, the client wouldn't be paying him as much as he is. submit your thoughts  recommend it! a book for every geek want to know more about networking ? have you ever wanted to write an ebook ? maybe you need to polish your web design skills? get fulllength books from the poor richard's series, including poor richard's email publishing , by chris pirillo, at gnometomes.com, for 50% off the suggested retail price of the print versions. click here to learn more. gnomefavorite my virtual model make a model of you wouldn't it be cool if you could physically walk into cyberspace? well, you can't... so stop thinking about it. however, you can design a virtual model of yourself on this site. choose your features like body shape, eyes, nose, lips, facial hair, height, and weight. the amazing thing is how closely your model resembles you. my only complaint is that you can't add glasses. how in the heck is my digital doppelganger supposed to see? once you're finished, the site can even offer style advice for your body type.

(sorry.) you are wrong on both counts. explanation is valid for symmetrical tcp, for others see explanations below.  yes, all packets in an established tcp connection have the ack flag set.  so all packets except syns are candidates for delay when traffic limits  are exceeded? whoops. you should change that to ... are always candidates for predictive or preventive delay. acks are delayed (per flow) in such a way that wanbound traffic reaching the edge router's ethernet interface does not exceed wan link speed (no router queues!). it does not wait for the link to be at or near saturation to act  that is why, unlike queueing, it is predictive and not reactive. it slows down the rate of transmission of sending hosts (on a perflow basis) to accommodate wan link speed limit and current network utilization, rather than fill up queues at lan speeds and empty them at wan speeds, eventually dropping the excess once the queue(s) fill up, informing hosts to slow down their rate of transmission once queues are beyond a fixed threshold (90%?). rate control works equally well for outbound and inbound traffic. ever heard of an effective queueing technology for inbound traffic? queueing packets after they have crossed a congested link does not make much sense, does it? re ipsecgre or other encapsulated traffic it obviously cannot dissect ipsecgre or other encapsulated traffic it sees the tunnel as one connection if the tunneling device is before the ps on the lan side (vpn gateway and router are two separate devices, ps between them). if the router does the tunneling, then the ps sees clear traffic. typically, in an organization the first scenario would be the case at headquarters and the second at branch offices. the ps at the branch sees traffic inside the tunnel whereas the unit at hq sees all traffic as one tunnel which allows full management of both tunneled and clear traffic at both ends. udp and asymmetrical tcp (where the ps and router only see the outgoing packet, return traffic coming back through a satellite downlink to a station on the lan) are handled differently. for asymmetrical tcp, it will time the release of packets to the receiving device, thereby indirectly timing the release of acknowledgements by the receiving host. this informs the sender's tcpip stack that it should slow the release of packets because limited bandwidth is available. for udp, it utilizes flowbased derivative random drop. it selectively drops only one packet at a time from flows that are predicted to cause congestion, which prevents heavy retransmissions and application timeouts. icmp packets exceeding policy limits are dropped. maybe you can do a special case for tcp and try to offload some of the queueing on  the endpoints, but i really don't see the real gain in that. the real gain is manageability and control. a lan host only knows about the state of its own connections and is oblivious to wan conditions until its tcpip stack learns (when router queues are nearly full) that the wan is congested. a ps will predict and inform the lan hosts' tcpip stacks of the ""speed limit to obey"" for every connection (based on policies and network conditions), avoiding congestion. control for asymmetrical tcp and udp may not be as ""tight"" as for symmetrical tcp, but it does work. queueing is akin to deploying cops only when traffic jams occur, vs. rate control where cops are permanently deployed throughout town, communicating with each other and with a central control point, predicting upcoming congestion and regulating traffic, ensuring a smooth flow of traffic. if there is potential for congestion, it will take a driver a hell of lot longer to cross town with first approach than it will with the second. do you agree?  original message  from ""mikael olsson"" to ""george j. jahchan"" cc ""firewalls list"" sent wednesday, july 24, 2002 450 pm subject re qos ""george j. jahchan"" wrote   the whole purpose of the device is to proactively prevent wan congestion   it sits between client and server (client insideserver outside or client  outsideserver inside  it does not make any difference) and proactively  adjusts the tcp window size (by delaying the acknowledgement) to get the  sending host to honor the speed limit for that individual connection  (calculated in realtime based on userdefined policies and current network  conditions). umm, don't get me wrong here, but i think you've been fed a lessthan accurate sales pitch. let's ponder this for a minute. the device works by delaying acks... that is packets with the ack flag set, right? ... letting this sink in for a while ... yes, all packets in an established tcp connection have the ack flag set. so all packets except syns are candidates for delay when traffic limits are exceeded? whoops. okay, let's assume for a second that the packets aren't actually delayed, but that the ack sequence numbers or tcp window size fields are rewritten (dicey). all you've accomplished is move the queueing (delaying) from the traffic shaper to the endpoints. you still get l7tol7 delays. big deal if it happens on the wire or in the stack. also, convincing endpoints to do delays probably results in lessthanperfect shaping since stack retransmit timings suddenly affect the actual bandwidth available rather than having the shaper itself do it the shaper knows exactly when there is bandwidth available. but this doesn't even begin to touch on other protocols like udp or icmp. or, for that matter, ipsecgrewhatever tunneled traffic. neither of them have sequence numbers or window sizes that you can manipulate. so, i'm forced to conclude that the packetshaper either sucks in a major way, or that your explanationthe explanation that you have been given of it is wrong. (sorry.) what i think happens is that the delay is 2msec as long as traffic limits aren't exceeded. this is reasonable. but when traffic exceeds the limits, things will begin to be queued. now, with a wellbehaved tcp stack, this will mean that it will fall back to lower transmission rates this is how tcp was designed, so that part isn't all wrong. and, again, this kind of shaping isn't rocket science. that is not to say that there are shapers out there that are just being plain dumb (always queueing and the selecting what gets transmitted out of the queue), but, well, i just can't see that you can get any smarter than queueing when limits are actually exceeded. maybe you can do a special case for tcp and try to offload some of the queueing on the endpoints, but i really don't see the real gain in that. respectfully, mikael olsson  mikael olsson, clavister ab storgatan 12, box 393, se891 28 rnskldsvik, sweden phone 46 (0)660 29 92 00 mobile 46 (0)70 26 222 05 fax 46 (0)660 122 50 ""it's july. i'm on vacation. can't you tell?

someone suggest me to buy the  websence , but i dont have the budget right now.   thanks a lot   michael   hiemstra, brenno wrote   michael,    the first thing is to build a security policy that  states what people are allowed to do and what  not. everyone needs to accept this policy and  if they violate it you can apply rules that you state  in your security policy.    if i had the option for your network setup i would  install a proxy server and demand every client  to connect to the proxy if they want to use the  internet.    the proxy will only allow ftp, and other ""approved""  services to connect to the internet. and you can let  them check to some database which websites are  allowed and deny access to sites that aren't allowed    your company firewall will only allow the proxy to connect  to the internet. clients are denied.    this way the clients cant connect directly to the internet  game servers and on the proxy you can deny clients  to connect to the game servers.    i hope this is an option for you.    regards,      brenno    original message  from michael zhao  sent dinsdag 23 juli 2002 1410  to  subject disable some sites    hi , all    i choose checkpoint fw1 as my firewall . i found many company users  play internet games like cs, ourgame . i find users download their  clients software and install on their local workstation , after run it  , the programe can connect to game server automatically .    usally , there are many sites of every internet game server. i.e. i want   disable accessing the game servers like xxx.ourgame.com from my internal   net , how can i do that except find all of their ip address , because it   is so complecat to do . who can tell me .    regards,  michael      firewalls mailing list     to unsubscribe     date thu, 25 jul 2002 150821 0600 from jerry lynde subject dnat with iptables question howdy folks, i've been scouring the online docs for solid info on how to accomplish dnat with iptables. essentially, i have converted the ipmasqadm lines of the form... ipmasqadm portfw a p tcp l $webout http r $webin http to iptables lines of the form... $iptables a prerouting t nat p tcp d $webout dport 80 j dnat to $webin80 with the accompanying lines... $iptables a forward i $intif o $extif m state state established,related j accept $iptables a forward i $extif o $intif m state state established,related j accept $iptables a forward i $extif o $intif p tcp j accept the last two lines seem functionally sorta redundant, but i threw em in in an effort to make this work. so far, i am unable to show that it's working correctly... i even tried logging all packets... $iptables a forward i $intif p tcp j log loglevel info $iptables a forward i $extif p tcp j log loglevel info but nothing show up in varlogmessages or anywhere else for that matter. this is on a redhat 7.3 box. any help, clues, flames, rt(his particular)fm, etc are appreciated. i read the list, so please don't reply directly in addition to the list resposne. thanks, jer  from ""reckhard, tobias"" subject re dnat with iptables question date fri, 26 jul 2002 083237 0200  $iptables a prerouting t nat p tcp d $webout dport 80  j dnat to  $webin80   with the accompanying lines...    $iptables a forward i $intif o $extif m state state  established,related j accept  $iptables a forward i $extif o $intif m state state  established,related j accept  $iptables a forward i $extif o $intif p tcp j accept   the last two lines seem functionally sorta redundant, but i  threw em in in  an effort to make this work. you're missing the new state. the initial syn packet will not match with either of the first two rules. it should match the third if it's inbound, though.  so far, i am unable to show that it's working correctly... i  even tried  logging all packets...   $iptables a forward i $intif p tcp j log loglevel info  $iptables a forward i $extif p tcp j log loglevel info   but nothing show up in varlogmessages or anywhere else for  that matter. you need to insert those logging rules above any accept, reject or deny rules for them to be of any use. are you sure the packets are hitting the box at all?

directions to larry's house. doh! i had to dig out the notebook at a close rest area in a vain attempt to quickly memorize the route. instead, i decided to transcribe the list on my jornada, which would be far easier (and safer) to read as i navigated through the streets. there's still a use for printers in this world, without question. reading text from the tiny screen bites. larger print and bold text on a sheet of paper is the way to go. at least i didn't leave my pda at home as well, which i actually considered doing. see you in august , randy nieland gnomenetwork satellite internet delays add up have you considered moving to a satellite internet provider at some point? while all of the marketing hype paints a rosy picture, there are a couple of things that you really must consider before writing the check. the birds are some 23,000 miles above the surface of the planet, so there is a significant delay while the bits float up and back down. the absolute minimum time for a packet to get from one place to another is nearly a quarter of a second. add in hops across the internet and other hardware latency and it's common to see ping times of between 500 and 1000 milliseconds  an eternity when you're talking about tcpip connections. now consider how vpn connections are affected, being that they are generally significantly slower on the ground without the extra 46,000 miles. ouch! this white paper is a tad marketing driven, but i think their explanation of technology and how they are addressing vpn oversatellite connections is quite informative. gnomesystem pgp outlook plugin vulnerability even encryption software is potentially exposed to security problems. network associates' pgp software, which interfaces directly with microsoft outlook, has been found to be vulnerable to malicious code within an email. exposed systems can be made to execute code of the attacker's choice, and because email can be sent from anywhere and to anywhere. tracking down the source could be rather difficult. hotfixes for each of nai's products are available on their website. gnomealertz today's top 5 kbalertz q311885  tapi error 0x8000022 occurs with an english (canada) or french (canada) system locale (q311885) q311842  help and support may stop responding when you use the network diagnostic tool (q311842) q311838  an opengl program may cause an access violation in windows xp 64bit edition (q311838) q311542  devices may not power up properly when resuming from standby (q311542) q311345  long delay with no prompt between the time when you click finish and when the desktop loads (q311345) get windows xp tips months after the release of windows xp professional and home editions, people are still learning the nuances of microsoft's newest operating system. whether you've been using it for a while or are planning to upgrade to the new os soon, this ebook is right up your alley. get your copy of lockergnome's top 50 windows xp tips now! recommend it! gnomeassistant intro to relational databases you know what a database is, right?

gnulinux from frederick noronha india there's good news round the corner  international organisations and prominent networks worldwide are waking up to the rich potential of freeopen source software, a field that is slowly being recognised for the immense promise it holds out to the third world. but can this be tapped speedily enough and effectively? from the unesco to the world bank, and other global organisations, all are catching up on the potential of using gnulinux as a potent tool in working towards development. more so in countries where the cost of a proprietorial office suite could eat up six months or more of the average citizen's earnings. united nation's development programme's ms. radhika lal a informationcommunication technology policy advisor, recently drew attention to a conference on open source for egovernment. it is to be held in washington, dc on october 1718. infodev, the cyberspace policy institute of the george washington university, and the undp are jointly behind this event. it is intended to draw participants from local, national and international organizations from both the public and private sector. this meet intends to present cases of 'best practices', raise awareness about the potential of open source and free software for egovernance. more importantly, it will be sharing experiences among policy makers, donors, users and consumers, universities, and industry specialists in open source, egovernment and related fields. ms lal works at the ictfordevelopment's special initiative bureau for development policy at the undp's east 45th street offices in new york. ictfordevelopment is a campaign to use more of infotech and the internet for global development and fighting problems like poverty and illiteracy. but despite quite a few shared goals and concerns with the gnulinux world, so far little networking has been done between these two separate circles. see other arms of the u.n.  besides, the undp, other arms of the united nations are also known to be showing increasing interest in the potential of free softwareopen source tools. parisheadquartered unesco (united nations education, scientific and cultural organisation) recently launched its own free software portal. it's at unesco's jeanclaude dauphin of the information society division also announced that this international organisation has been looking out for contributors with a good knowledge of the free software movement in relation with unesco fields of competence  education, science and culture. it zeroed in particularly on those coming from the third world (also called the 'south' countries) who could could make propositions for ""revising, updating and extending the unesco free software portal"" as well as for including new basic documents. ""this work could be done using a fee or consultant contract and the fee can be discussed depending on the amount of work described in the contract,"" said dauphin. check out the sites at unesco libraries portal ( unesco archives portal ( unesco free software portal ( unesco observatory on the information society ( new tools for cdsisis  recently, unesco also announced the launch of new tools for data exchange from and to its cdsisis software. these two new tools  impexp2709 and isisascii v 0.92  have recently been released for data exchange from and to unesco's software package cdsisis. cdsisis is a generalized information storage and retrieval system that is freely distributed, and has attracted users in places like libraries within the third world. the new utilities have been released with their source code (gpl license). see meanwhile, undp's apdip (asiapacific development information programme) based in kuala lumpur, malaysia, is also learnt to be thinking seriously about organizing some kind of a consultation on open source, gnulinux and related issues. ""we want to see how we can further this cause in the region,"" apdip's shahid akhtar told this correspondent. niranjan rajani of pakistani origin but based in the birthplace of linux, finland, is now working on a research project on ""significance of freeopensource software for developing countries"". this project is financed by the finnish foreign ministry, and he has undertaken to write the paper by the end of november this year, for maailma.net, a local division of oneworld.net. this project's goal is to find out, evaluate and analyze the extent of use of fsoss, especially some of its most significant and popular projects gnulinux, apache, mozilla, openoffice etc. in the developing or third world countries. it will also look at its possible impact on economies, societies and lives of these countries. convincing governments  in india, organisations like red hat have been putting out slick presentations to convince governments and officials to try out open source. shift over boldly to the world of 'open source' and 'free' software. that's the message that governments across india were recently with, as official computerisation efforts get bogged down due to spiraling software costs and speedy softwarefuelled hardware obsolence. senior it and egovernance officials from across the country tuned in attentively during a recent seminar in goa, as executives from computing giant ibm and leading linux systems supplier red hat india narrated long lists of benefits that governments could get from going the linux way. pointing to examples from across the globe, red hat india argued that the us department of energy has built supercomputers on gnulinux, the chinese are making linux the official server operating system  to be widely used in varsities, military installations and within government. some months back, an organisation under india's ministry of information technology  called the erdci (electronics research and development centre of india)  entered into a strategic alliance with leading linux systems supplier red hat india to popularize the 'open source' solution in the government sector. on networks like the edcworld banksupport gkd (global knowledge for development), issues of free software and open source often make it to the news. gnulinux is a suitable tool in organising too, as it was recently pointed out. (see ""the low income networking and communication (linc) project of the welfare law center has helped many lowincome led organizing groups acquire access to the internet and use technology more effectively,"" says dirk slater while these groups have increased their abilities to communicate with one another and their allies by using the internet, one communication hurdle remains  communicating with their leadership via the internet. despite many ""digital divide"" initiatives addressing access to the internet in lowincome communities, access is still an issue. public internet access points, such as libraries and schools, are not sufficient, as slater has pointed out. many lowincome leaders do not have access to the internet where it would make the most impact  in their homes. linc argues that the need for internet communication is particularly great for rural groups whose members live far apart and cannot have frequent facetoface meetings because of distance, time and money constraints. ""we began to explore the idea of using linux, a free operating system that works well on older computers, when we learned of microsoft's decision to discontinue support of its older operating systems like windows 95 according to slater, who is 'senior circuit rider' for the lowincome networking and communications (linc) project at the welfare law center. linc protagonists say they had also been ""troubled"" by the frequent problems that occur for windows users just by having windows run on its own. ""giving a person who lives in a rural area an older computer with windows seemed like we were just asking for trouble. we also attempted to identify similar projects but had limited success,"" says slater. linc wanted to increase its ability to provide stable desktop systems using donated computers for board members and leaders of lowincome led organizations that linc serves. ""our goal is to increase the ability of linc project partner groups to use opensource software to support their organizing work. we also wanted to document the project as much as we possibly could, so we could provide details of our experiences for others doing similar projects,"" linc explains. linc identified a partner in grass roots organizing in mexico, mo, and installed gnulinux on 10 computers used as standalone workstations in people's homes. gnulinux was also installed on a brand new standalone computer to work as the main computer in the gro office. links were built with the mizzou linux users group for ongoing local support. ""we still have a long way to go before we can call this a completely successful project. after a period of a few months we will assess whether the board members are actually using the computers to communicate more effectively,"" said slater. to view the daily journals on the project with gro please visit the linc project linux pages at  need to network  bala pillai who was earlier based in malaysia and now in sydneyaustralia, is founder of tamil innaiyam ( an organisation to promote the tamil language worldwide. he points to the impact gnulinux is making in some distant areas of the third world. says pillai ""the most interactive open sourcelinux community in our time zoneasia springs out of the philippines. primarily because the filipino psyche is a more secure psyche, a more selfconfident psyche. ""folks who are selfconfident worry about the future less, and allocate more time diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and reechoing it. filipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing  we should look to more symbiosis with them,"" says he. pillai also notes that the manilabased miguel paraz, whom he interacted with since 1996, is a key catalyst in the filipino linux community. "" is a good starting point to get a feel for the key open source catalysts in the philippines,"" says he. kuala lumpur, malaysiabased dinesh who runs is another lead open source catalyst from the region, explains pillai. ""do look for symbiosis opportunities there too,"" he suggests. ""i see lots of room for us to symbiosis together. for example, there is likely to be areas where we diagnosing, documenting, analyzing, coding or publicizing where there is overduplication. if we coordinated ourselves and found out where our circles and priorities intersect , we could share this work and get fruits out faster,"" he adds.  frederick noronha  freelance journalist  goa  india 832.409490  409783 bytesforall  gnulinux email  mobile 9822 122436 (goa)  saligao goa india writing with a difference... on what makes the difference   send submissions for comp.os.linux.announce to   please remember a short description of the software and the location.   this group is archived at    from frederick noronha subject attn programmers support offered flosssarai initiative date 8 sep 2002 012545 gmt dear friends, can we manage to get some money into backing freelibre open source software initiatives, that would help young volunteers out there to support their cashstrapped initiatives? sarai.net, a delhibased initiative under the csds (centre for the study of developing societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea. jeebesh bagchi sent in this offer recently. it could surely be of help particularly to college students and others wanting to make a break in free softwareopen source, but hamstrung by resources. it might help if projects are initially kept small and definitely workable, i guess. this is my own gutlevel feeling, but maybe bigger initiatives which are clearly workable could also prove convincing. if such experiments prove useful, maybe there would be a good case for greater support to free softwareopen source developers in regions like ours. fn  forwarded message  the sarai programme, centre for the study of developing societies, delhi ( invites applications for support grants to projects in the area of free software, open source software and social usage of software sarai invites programmers (practictioners as well as students) to propose projects in the area of free and open source software applications relevant to educational, social and community needs. we are looking for original ideas, as well as proposals to localize and adapt existing software and applications to south asian conditions, for example  desktops in hindi, open office and gimp in hindi. lighter versions of desktops like kde, innovations that creatively optimises older lower configuration machines, linux documentation in hindi, games using local context, etc. what is sarai sarai is a public initiative of media practitioners and scholars looking at media cultures and urban life. sarai's interests are in the field of old and new media, information and communication technologies, free software, cinema, and urban space  its politics, built form, ecology, culture and history, with a strong commitment to making knowledge available in the public domain. it is a programme of the centre for the study of developing societies, delhi. for more information visit sarai is committed to promoting the free software and open source vision. conditions applicants should be resident in india, and should have a bank account in any bank operating in india. these are support grants and grantees will be free to pursue their primary occupations, if any. mail your project proposal, workplan and cv to both the following addresses with a copy to please mark your subjectline 'floss (freelibre open source software) initiative'. also point out what you see as the relevance of your work, and how you plan to share the resultant software once finalised. enquires last date for submission october 15th, 2002. note proposals from teams, partnerships, collectives, faculty are welcome, so long as the grant amount is administered by a single individual, and the funds are deposited in a single bank account in the name of an individual.    send submissions for comp.os.linux.announce to   please remember a short description of the software and the location.   this group is archived at     for your reference  the service address, to which questions about the list itself and requests to be added to or deleted from it should be directed, is internet you can submit announcements to be moderated via internet linux may be obtained via one of these ftp sites ftp.funet.fi publinux tsx11.mit.edu publinux sunsite.unc.edu publinux end of linuxannounce digest",[],28700,0,0,hard_ham_testing

narration, croupier pessimistically compares our lives to those of hapless casino gamblers. we know the odds are stacked against us, yet we continue to play the games. gamblers, or ""punters"" as they are more derogatorily known, however, play their games under the watchful eyes of the croupier (casino dealer). constantly pulled by the siren song of fast money, the croupier knows better than anyone that to play is to lose. thus, the cool croupier relegates himself to his addiction of watching others lose. jack manfred (clive owen) is the croupier, raised by his croupier father (nicholas ball) who taught him all the tricks of the trade. through his losses both in the casino and in his personal life, jack's father also taught jack that the only way to win is not to play. punters are sorry sods the croupier is king. from father to son, the lesson passes  watching others strive and falter is the only real enjoyment in life. despite decades of croupier training, jack is compelled to write the great novel burning deep inside him, yearning to escape. jack's publisher regrettably relates to jack that his novel idea is trite stories of real life graft and corruption are what sell. when jack's father informs jack of a casino opening in a small london casino, jack snatches the opportunity to parlay his skill into a novel exposing the seedy underbelly of london's casinos. unfortunately, jack's excop girlfriend sees the job hardening and irreparably changing jack for the worst. in an attempt to fool himself, jack creates alter ego ""jake"" to bear the brunt of inequity, attempting to maintain jack both morally and physically unscathed. the absence of any clear delineation between the personas becomes apparent when a lovely punter (alex kingston) approaches jack with a scheme to rob the casino. jack slowly comes to the realization that no one can have it both ways, either in the casino or in life. you are either in the game, or you are not. seasoned veteran director michael hodges deftly crafts this tale around the subtle talents of the ultra cool clive owen. owen rules this drama, not with flex and volume, but with glances and nods. less is truly more, much more, in this low budget escape from the unsatisfying blockbuster suspense films of recent memory. croupier proves that it is not a large budget, but direction, dialogue and acting that drive the genre. region 1 encoding (us and canada only) format color, widescreen anamorphic, closed captioned sound dolby digital 2.0 stereo deleted scenes review by brett trout gnomewallpaper surgenate for

(keep sending me your comments.) we have been deemphasizing running microsoft windows programs because many of you told us you detest spending hundreds of dollars on individual software programs, forced upgrades and activation codes. it's not just the operating system, but costly microsoft programs you're wanting to avoid. consequently, we've been emphasizing clicknrun because it will change the way you think about software. having a neatly categorized library  of 1,000 software titles all for a flat annual fee at your digital fingertips is an entirely new way to think about paying for software. it's immediate, elegant and affordable. there are lots of mischaracterizations about lindows.com swirling around  which happens when you have a small organization which can't address every question or publication. we'll do a better job of addressing these in the future. for now, i wrote up answers to the top myths about lindows.com. check them out by visiting grade b  overall b michael robertson please visit support.lindows.com  to answer questions you may have about lindowsos or lindows.com. bringing choice to your computer! lindowsos is presently available on lindowsos certified computers being offered from lindows.com  builder partners. the general release of lindowsos (available now for download and preview to lindows.com  insider partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run lindowsos on their existing computer hardware. the general release version will support a wider range of computer hardware and includes unique features such as a ""friendlyinstall"" alongside an existing microsoftr windows operating system, a streamlined installation process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a select set of ""bridge"" windowscompatible programs. for more information see  lindowsos and lindows.com are trademarks of lindows.com, inc. linuxr is a registered trademark of linus torvalds. microsoftr windowsr operating system is a registered trademark or service mark of the microsoft corporation. mm18  to change your mailing list options please go to","['http://support.lindows.com/', 'http://www.lindows.com/warehouse', 'http://www.lindows.com/clicknrun', 'http://www.lindows.com/mm', 'http://lindows.com/mm', 'http://lindows.com/signup', 'http://www.lindows.com/lindows_products_details.php?id=8966', 'http://www.lindows.com/walmart', 'http://www.lindows.com/myths', 'http://lindows.com/timeline', 'http://lindows.com/', 'http://www.lindows.com/products', 'http://www.lindows.com/signup', 'http://www.lindows.com/builder', 'http://www.lindows.com/update']",7234,15,0,hard_ham_testing

if you're set solid with your current machine, there's no use to add the overhead of pnp to your system's kernel code, or as a loadable module. if, on the other hand, you've got pci or (on an older system) isa slots just begging to be filled, build this support into the kernel or select it as modules. see, this kernel gig isn't really so tough. in fairness, we're hitting the high points without a heady discussion of the hidden workings. the discussion of pnp alone could comprise a full series in penguin shell. but, so far, the configuration has been pretty straightforward. tomorrow, we will dive a bit deeper, with a discussion of block device kernel configuration. recommend it! send us a gnomecore tip gnomefile liquidwar ""liquid war is a truly original multiplayer wargame. you control an army formed with thousands of pixels (fighters) which look like liquid and try to eat your opponent. you can play against a primitive npcai or up to 5 other human players. network play is available."" recommend it! send us a gnomefile suggestion gnomevoice gnome 2 installation notes scribbled by dale hirt ""as always, am loving the newsletter. i've been getting it since day one, and i love all the stuff that you have put in it.

enter splenda. an artificial sweetener that has finally made it to waterloo, iowa. most of what diana and i use sugar for has been modified to use splenda instead, with good results. hopefully this coffee thing is just a temporary kick like it usually is. i have to brush my teeth after a cup or two from the nasty breath. it's fun to test out the dragonbreath on the cat to see just how bad it really is. if bootes sniffs a couple of times, it's not too bad, but if she instantly recoils, time to employ the sonicare for a couple of minutes. see what you've started, jake? see you in august , randy nieland gnomenetwork exchange titanium details emerge oracle recently announced their intention to compete directly with microsoft exchange, even accepting outlook as an email client. in what seems like a direct response, we're handed details of the 2003 release of exchange titanium. i've always liked what exchange can do, so i'm certainly looking forward to seeing what the new features will be all about, but i'm also interested in what oracle will be bringing to the table. better email functionality, control and security are the name of the game, whoever ends up being the vendor of choice. included in this qa is a screenshot of what outlook may look like once office 11 is released. it's an interesting concept shot, showing some new ways they plan to handle email views. it doesn't say anything for exchange functionality, but it's worth noting regardless. gnomesystem better pocket pc audio unearthed by david spencer an open source project is bringing a different spin to audio and video on pocket pcs, and my first impression is... cool! i like what they're working on here. i decided to wipe out my jornada yesterday, so i haven't done a direct comparison between the ipaq 3870 and jornada 565 for audio quality using this player, which has an equalizer builtin, but it definitely has potential judging from how it sounds on the ipaq right out of the gate. definitely give this a peek if you're one of those that likes to play audio and video on a pocket pc. quite a few different versions are supported, so you should be able to find something appropriate to your device. gnomealertz today's top 5 kbalertz q320278  wd ""the custom dictionary is not available "" error when you use portuguese (brazilian) proofing tools (q320278) q313147  getntmsobjectattribute does not return correct size when the buffer is too small (q313147) q313317  a gpo ""register ptr records"" setting of ""disabled"" is ignored (q313317) q310869  stop error when you start windows after you connect a scanner (q310869) q310772  pcmcia device may not work in windows xp (q310772) recommend it! gnomeassistant 50 os x tips whether you're making the ""switch"" from windows, upgrading from a previous version of mac os, or just want some helpful tricks to make using os x easier, this ebook is for you. jake cover's everything from user management, to some terminal basics, to how to navigate differences between os 9 and os x. get your copy today ! where's java? three readers asked me about this very thing this week, and it's something you should probably know about if you use windows xp. microsoft didn't bundle the java virtual machine with windows xp, and since the release of xp, the jvm has been avaialble via the windows update site as a ""convenience"" to users. part of sun's legal complaints surrounding how microsoft has handled java was that microsoft did not have the right to distribute their implementation via the web, though they did have licensing rights to include it with windows. so essentially, microsoft has things backwards, as it seems. well, to avoid further web distribution arguments, microsoft has yanked the jvm from the windows update site and all other areas of microsoft's web site. microsoft is still planning to include java with windows xp service pack 1. you'll have to plan for java support accordingly, as sp1 is still a ways off and you can't get it from microsoft at this point. if you need it for a new installation of windows xp in the short term, sun will gladly provide you with their own distibution . gnomestuff another xeon deal served up by warren dugas i mentioned a really nice deal on compaq evo w6000 dual xeon workstations a few weeks back, which i know several of you took advantage of, but the $1999 price tag likely scared off many others. if you still want to get into a xeon, check this one out. tigerdirect is offering an evo w8000 workstation with a single 1.7ghz processor, 18.2gb 15,000rpm u160 drive, 48x cdrom and licenses for both windows 2000 pro and nt 4.0 workstation for $699.99. note that there is no memory and no video card included, so you'll have to scrounge those for yourself, but it really is a pretty good deal, on the whole. also realize that these systems take rambus memory, which will add a bit of cost, so be sure you know what you're getting  a wickedfast workstation, to be sure! expandability is also quite amazing with these machines. recommend it! your subscribed email address is  to unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription management page. for further information, please refer to the gnomecredits in the sidebar. look over here download tip ebooks latest windows daily latest digital media latest tech specialist latest penguin shell latest apple core latest web weekly latest bits  bytes latest audio show low price search our tech conference microsoft office tips pc productivity tips cool internet tips windows 2000 tips windows xp tips tell a friend about us! suggest a feature advertise with us hightech job search chat with gnomies watch the webcams computer power user read past issues download xsetup about lockergnome our privacy policy view more options our xml  rss feed syndicate our tips link to lockergnome get chris's book email a suggestion your rant  rave general feedback the editor's blog email the editor sound systems yamaha rxv1200 sony davc900 harman kardon avr520 denon avr5803 pioneer vsxd811s pioneer elite vsx49tx sony htddw840 yamaha htr5560 bose ls122bk sony davc450 gnomespecials manage your workgroup form pilot say the time 5.0 boomer  stream now create webcd catalog easy web editor kleptomania tagrename pretty good solitaire visualize color combos firststop websearch ecobuilder book collector get listed here question which group is 250,000 strong and always looking for stuff to make their personal and professional lives run smoother?

""in the past, airlines were loath to have longer connection times because flights were listed in travel agents' computers by elapsed time,"" said the journal. ""now, online booking tools and search engines most often list flights by price, not time."" in this age of pennypinching, american's worried about lowcost carriers, not the big guys like, um, us air and united. speaking of united, it's hard to come up with a verb for its parent company's stock that doesn't invoke an air disaster. let's just say it didn't go up yesterday. the $3.80 share price may be the least of ual's worries while it waits for an increasingly unlikely $1.8 billion loan from the air transportation stabilization board. ""the atsb expects an applicant's workers, suppliers and creditors to make concessions to help the airline repay the loans and thus protect u.s. taxpayers' interests,"" said the l.a. times. sounds nice for uninvolved taxpayers but not so good to some of united's unions, which are balking at a wage cut. workers did enough by deferring $498 million in retroactive pay this year, said the 36,000member machinists' union. analysts moaned in antilabor frustration. the basic problem here is too many empty airplane seats, and nonu.s. outlets didn't have a lot of sympathy.

(your results might differ depending on your machine characteristics, but you should see a distinct difference in the result for arraylist as compared to that for linkedlist . the same is true for the other programs in this tip.) clearly, linkedlist is a bad choice in this situation. the binary search algorithm inherently uses random access, and linkedlist does not support fast random access. the time to do a random access in a linkedlist is proportional to the size of the list. by comparison, random access in an arraylist has a fixed time. you can use the randomaccess marker interface to check whether a list supports fast random access void f(list lst)  if (lst instanceof randomaccess)   supports fast random access   arraylist implements the randomaccess interface, and linkedlist . does not. note that collections.binarysearch does take advantage of the randomaccess property, to optimize searches. do these results prove that arraylist is always a better choice? not necessarily. there are many cases where linkedlist does better. also note that there are many situations where an algorithm can be implemented efficiently for linkedlist . an example is reversing a linkedlist using collections.reverse . the internal algorithm does this, and gets reasonable performance, by using forward and backward iterators. let's look at another example. suppose you have a list of elements, and you do a lot of element inserting and deleting to the list. in this case, linkedlist is the better choice. to demonstrate that, consider the following ""worst case"" scenario. in this demo, a program repeatedly inserts elements at the beginning of a list. the code looks like this import java.util. public class listdemo2  static final int n  50000  time how long it takes to add  n objects to a list static long timelist(list lst)  long start  system.currenttimemillis() object obj  new object() for (int i  0 i  n i)  lst.add(0, obj)  return system.currenttimemillis()  start  public static void main(string args)   do timing for arraylist system.out.println( ""time for arraylist  ""  timelist(new arraylist()))  do timing for linkedlist system.out.println( ""time for linkedlist  ""  timelist(new linkedlist()))   when you run this program, the result should look something like this time for arraylist  4859 time for linkedlist  125 these results are pretty much the reverse of the previous example. when an element is added to the beginning of an arraylist , all of the existing elements must be pushed back, which means a lot of expensive data movement and copying. by contrast, adding an element to the beginning of a linkedlist simply means allocating an internal record for the element and then adjusting a couple of links. adding to the beginning of a linkedlist has fixed cost, but adding to the beginning of an arraylist has a cost that's proportional to the list size. so far, this tip has looked at speed issues, but what about space? let's look at some internal details of how arraylist and linkedlist are implemented in java 2 sdk, standard edition v 1.4. these details are not part of the external specification of these classes, but are illustrative of how such classes work internally. the linkedlist class has a private internal class defined like this private static class entry  object element entry next entry previous  each entry object references a list element, along with the next and previous elements in the linkedlist  in other words, a doublylinked list. a linkedlist of 1000 elements will have 1000 entry objects linked together, referencing the actual list elements. there is significant space overhead in a linkedlist structure, given all these entry objects. an arraylist has a backing object array to store the elements. this array starts with a capacity of 10. when the array needs to grow, the new capacity is computed as newcapacity  (oldcapacity  3)  2  1 notice that the array capacity grows each time by about 50%. this means that if you have an arraylist with a large number of elements, there will be a significant amount of space wasted at the end. this waste is intrinsic to the way arraylist works. if there was no spare capacity, the array would have to be reallocated for each new element, and performance would suffer dramatically. changing the growth strategy to be more aggressive (such as doubling the size at each reallocation) would result in slightly better performance, but it would waste more space. if you know how many elements will be in an arraylist , you can specify the capacity to the constructor. you can also call the trimtosize method after the fact to reallocate the internal array. this gets rid of the wasted space. so far, this discussion has assumed that either an arraylist or a linkedlist is ""right"" for a given application. but sometimes, other choices make more sense. for example, consider the very common situation where you have a list of keyvalue pairs, and you would like to retrieve a value for a given key. you could store the pairs in an n x 2 object array. to find the right pair, you could do a sequential search on the key values. this approach works, and is a useful choice for very small lists (say 10 elements or less), but it doesn't scale to big lists. another approach is to sort the keyvalue pairs by ascending key value, store the result in a pair of arraylists , and then do a binary search on the keys list. this approach also works, and is very fast. yet another approach is to not use a list structure at all, but instead use a map structure (hash table), in the form of a hashmap . which is faster, a binary search on an arraylist , or a hashmap ? here's a final example that compares these two import java.util. public class listdemo3  static final int n  500000  lists of keys and values static list keys static list values  fill the keys list with ascending order key  values and fill the values list with  corresponding values (key) static  integer keyvec  new integern integer valuevec  new integern random rn  new random() for (int i  0, currval  0 i  n i)  keyveci  new integer(currval) valueveci  new integer(currval) currval  rn.nextint(100)  1  keys  arrays.aslist(keyvec) values  arrays.aslist(valuevec)   fill a map with keyvalue pairs static map map  new hashmap() static  for (int i  0 i  n i)  map.put(keys.get(i), values.get(i))    do binary search lookup of all keys static long timelist()  long start  system.currenttimemillis() for (int i  0 i  n i)  int indx  collections.binarysearch( keys, keys.get(i))  sanity check of returned value  from binary search if (indx ! i)  system.out.println( "" error n"")   return system.currenttimemillis()  start   do map lookup of all keys static long timemap()  long start  system.currenttimemillis() for (int i  0 i  n i)  integer value  (integer)map.get( keys.get(i))  sanity check of value returned  from map lookup if (value ! values.get(i))  system.out.println( "" error n"")   return system.currenttimemillis()  start  public static void main(string args)   do timing for list implementation system.out.println(""list time  ""  timelist())  do timing for map implementation system.out.println(""map time  ""  timemap())   the program sets up lists of keys and values, and then uses two different techniques to map keys to values. one approach uses a binary search on a list, the other a hash table. when you run the listdemo3 program, you should get a result that looks something like this arraylist time  1000 hashmap time  281 in this example, n has a value of 500000. approximately, log2(n)  1 comparisons are required in an average successful binary search, so each binary search lookup in the arraylist will take about 18 comparisons. by contrast, a properly implemented hash table typically requires only 13 comparisons. so you should expect the hash table to be faster in this case. however, binary search is still useful. for example, you might want to do a lookup in a sorted list and then find keys that are close in value to the key used for the lookup. doing this is easy with binary search, but impossible in a hash table. keys in a hash table are stored in apparent random order. also, if you are concerned with worstcase performance, the binary search algorithm offers a much stronger performance guarantee than a hash table scheme. you might also consider using treemap for doing lookups in sorted collections of keyvalue pairs. let's summarize the key points presented in this tip appending elements to the end of a list has a fixed averaged cost for both arraylist and linkedlist. for arraylist , appending typically involves setting an internal array location to the element reference, but occasionally results in the array being reallocated. for linkedlist , the cost is uniform and involves allocating an internal entry object. inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an arraylist implies that the rest of the list must be moved. inserting or deleting elements in the middle of a linkedlist has fixed cost. a linkedlist does not support efficient random access an arraylist has space overhead in the form of reserve capacity at the end of the list. a linkedlist has significant space overhead per element. sometimes a map structure is a better choice than a list . for more information about using arraylist and linkedlists , see section 16.6, list, and section 16.7, map and sortedmap, in "" the java tm programming language third edition "" by arnold, gosling, and holmes. also see the collections trail in the java tutorial, third edition . back to top using zerolength arrays suppose that you are writing a java application that involves some sort of data filtering. you have some raw data that you want to clean up and process in various ways. one of the methods you've written takes an array of integers, along with minimum and maximum values. the method goes through the array and eliminates ""outliers,"" that is, values that are too small or too big. the result of the filtering process is a new array of cleanedup data. how could you implement this kind of filtering method? here's one approach import java.util. public class zerodemo1   filter input array and throw away values  that are less than minval or greater than  maxval static int filterdata( int indata, int minval, int maxval)   check parameters for errors if (indata  null)  throw new nullpointerexception( ""indata is null"")  if (maxval  minval)  throw new illegalargumentexception( ""maxval  minval"")   count number of valid values  in input array int validcnt  0 for (int i  0 i  indata.length i)  if (indatai  minval  indatai  maxval)  validcnt    if no valid values, return null if (validcnt  0)  return null   copy valid values to new array  and return it int outdata  new intvalidcnt for (int i  0, j  0 i  indata.length i)  if (indatai  minval  indatai  maxval)  outdataj  indatai   return outdata  public static void main(string args)   set up test array of integers int indata  new int1, 3, 17, 8, 59  filter out values not in the range 110 int outdata1  filterdata(indata, 1, 10) for (int i  0 i  outdata1.length i)  system.out.println(outdata1i)   filter out values not  in the range 100200 int outdata2  filterdata( indata, 100, 200) for (int i  0 i  outdata2.length i)  system.out.println(outdata2i)    the filterdata method does two scans of the input array. the first scan counts the number of valid data values. then the method allocates a new array of the appropriate size, and copies the good values to it. if there are no good values, the method returns a null value for the array reference. the result of running the zerodemo1 program is 1 3 8 exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.nullpointerexception at zerodemo1.main(zerodemo1.java72) the problem with this program is a rather basic one. the second call of filterdata returns a null value, and the program fails to take this possibility into account. a better approach in this example would be to comment out the block of code that tests for the possibility of no valid data values  if (validcnt  0)  return null   when there is no valid data, the code will fall through to the next line, where a zerolength array is allocated int outdata  new int0 this is perfectly legal java usage. the representation of java arrays includes the length of the array, and it's therefore possible to tell if an array has zero length. for the zerodemo1 example, if you anticipate that validcnt will often be zero, that is, data filtering will often eliminate all values from the input, then you could optimize away the second input scan by adding code like this int outdata  new intvalidcnt if (validcnt  0)  return outdata  note that usage such as int outdata  new int is also legal, to initialize an array with a zerolength set of integer constants. in general, it's best not to return null from a method that returns an array type. always returning an array, even if the array has zero length, greatly improves the generality of algorithms. if you anticipate that your methods will often return zerolength arrays, you might be concerned about the performance implications of allocating many such arrays. in this case, you can allocate a single array, and always return the same one, as follows private static final int zerolengtharray  new int0 this array is immutable (it can't be changed), and can be shared throughout your application. there's another way that zerolength arrays are used, as illustrated in the following example import java.util. public class zerodemo2  public static void main(string args)   set up arraylist and add strings to it list stringlist  new arraylist() stringlist.add(""string 1"") stringlist.add(""string 2"") stringlist.add(""string 3"")  convert to string array string out  ( string)stringlist.toarray( new string0) for (int i  0 i  out.length i)  system.out.println(outi)    the result of running the zerodemo2 program is string 1 string 2 string 3 the zerodemo2 program sets up an arraylist , and adds three strings to it. then the program calls toarray to get a string array of the three elements in the arraylist . in this example, the argument to toarray is ""new string0"". this argument serves a couple of purposes. first, if you have a string array that's big enough to hold the elements of the arraylist , you can specify it as the argument to toarray . the method will use the string array. but if your array is not big enough, then the toarray method allocates an array to return the elements. it uses the type of the array that was passed in to determine the type of the allocated array. arraylist stores its element references in an object array. the toarray method needs to be told if there is some other type (such as string) to be used for returning the array of elements. the method uses reflection ( java.lang.reflect.array.newinstance ) to create an array of the appropriate type. for more information about using zerolength arrays, see item 27 ""return zerolength arrays, not nulls"" in ""

(a) $38,000 for lap dancing at strip clubs near military bases. (b) $3,400 for a sumo wrestling suit and $9,800 for halloween costumes. (c) $7,373 for closing costs on a home and $16,000 for a corporate golf membership. (d) $4,600 for white beach sand and $19,000 worth of decorative ""river rock"" at a military base in the arabian desert. (e) all of the above. ""incredibly, the answer is 'all of the above,' said steve dasbach, libertarian party executive director. ""thanks to the federal government's policy of doling out credit cards with no questions asked, the military has launched a raid on your wallet."" the shocking revelations are contained in a general accounting office audit released last week that uncovered $101 million in ""seemingly unneeded expenditures"" made by the air force and army in 2000 and 2001. the purchases were made possible by the federal government's lax credit card policy at least 1.4 million defense department employees carry credit cards, and last year they used them to splurge on $6.1 billion in goods and services, the audit found. in one case, a group of 200 soldiers used their military ids and governmentissued travel cards to get cash at adultentertainment bars, then spent the money there. the clubs charged a 10 percent fee to supply the soldiers with cash  then billed the full amount to their travel cards as a restaurant charge, the gao found. ""are these warriors really fighting terrorism while frolicking in a strip club, or defending our country while wearing a sumo wrestling suit?"" asked dasbach. ""americans who support a bigger defense budget, take note the pentagon frequently behaves like any other bloated, reckless government agency. it promises your money will be spent on the worthiest of causes, then squanders it on things you could never even imagine."" other spending uncovered by the audit included $45,000 for luxury cruises, $1,800 for executive pillows, and $24,000 for a sofa and armchair at a military installation in the middle east, dasbach noted. some military employees actually defended the purchases, the audit noted, by saying that recreational items such as golf memberships can be ""a useful tool for building good relations with a host country"" such as saudi arabia or the united arab emirates. not surprisingly, dasbach said, the audit found ""little evidence of documented disciplinary action"" against those who misused the cards, so taxpayers may end up paying the tab. ""it's time to impose a little military discipline on these deadbeat defense department workers, and force them to personally reimburse taxpayers for every penny of improper spending,"" he said. ""then cut the pentagon's massive $379 billion budget to help guard against such wasteful spending in the future. perhaps that's one way to force the pentagon to spend its resources defending the country, instead of offending the taxpayer."" begin pgp signature version 2.6.2 iqcvawubpua6fdcse1knqg7raqgakwpzpfw0uq3bplnxxmnlwq2affb1fsajnj qomt9q4tbhiyjhidgddugxoubipfvyiwesr1pjodofe8dyf2hv4gns9hsmksgc 76rzvuitnf2dbesay8ttcudldc51mjgxigcgpkcyj0wn11rrbktkveefsntabz m8ibvfidpyi 9fyc end pgp signature  the libertarian party 2600 virginia ave. nw, suite 100 voice 2023330008 washington dc 20037 fax 2023330072  for subscription changes, please use the www form at",[],4399,0,0,hard_ham_testing

single email saturday, july 13, 2002 if you've ever taped a ""seinfeld"" episode or traded music online, uncle sam may want youto stop. draft legislation that is winding its way through congress would sharply limit americans' rights relating to copying music, taping tv shows and transferring files through the internet. the first part of their proposal, which would limit backup copies , has drawn objections from academics and nonprofit groups that have reviewed it. under current copyright law, americans who record a tv program or radio segment generally may ""sell or otherwise dispose of"" that analog recording or digital file as they wish. the proposed bill would end that exemption, handing copyright owners substantial new control over the distribution of their works by curtailing a consumer's right to copy material under a doctrine known as ""fair use."" another salvo in the copyright battle was delivered when a federal judge said that record labels and film studios could expand an ongoing copyright lawsuit to include sharman networks, which distributes the popular kazaa software. the recording industry association of america and the motion picture association of america last october sued three prominent fileswapping companies in los angeles federal court. the suit named morpheus parent streamcast networks, grokster and kazaa bv, the netherlandsbased company that originally created the kazaa software. however, in february, kazaa bv sold the kazaa fileswapping software to sharman, a company later revealed to be based in vanuatu, a small island in the south pacific. the recording and movie industry trade groups asked permission to add that company to the lawsuit in june. a judge ruled this week that sharman could be added to the lawsuit. shoring up u.s. security computer security is becoming increasingly critical to president bush's proposal for a homeland defense department. when bush formally proposed the department last month, he never mentioned the internet or socalled cybersecurity. but as capitol hill scrutinizes the proposal, politicians are fretting about techsavvy terroristsand insisting any new agency must shield the united states from electronic attacks as well. house republicans have asked committees for any suggested changes to the white housebacked bill by the end of the week. included in the proposal are radical changes for the u.s. government's internet defenses. the plan would stitch together nearly all computer protection functions, from the commerce department's critical infrastructure assurance office to the computer security division of the national institute of standards and technology to the federal computer incident response center. additionally, the proposed department is likely to get its own privacy czar . a draft of the legislation seen by cnet news.com states that the secretary of homeland security must appoint a privacy officer to ensure that new technologies ""sustain and do not erode"" privacy protections and to verify that the agency's massive databases operate within federal guidelines. who's running your computer? perhaps a more immediate security concern to individuals is what is going on now with their computers. apple computer os x users could let hackers piggyback malicious code on downloads from the company's softwareupdate service. according to the bugtraq mailing list, a hacker named russell harding has posted full instructions for how to fool apple's softwareupdate feature to allow a hacker to install a backdoor on any mac running os x. the exploit takes advantage of softwareupdate, apple's software updating mechanism in os x, which checks weekly for new updates from the company. according to harding, who claims to have discovered the exploit, the feature downloads updates over the web with no authentication and installs them on a system. so far, there are no patches available for this problem. users of microsoft's internet explorer, outlook and outlook express applications may be vulnerable to a recently discovered software flaw that could leave their system open to malicious code carried on web pages or in emails. a security researcher and partner at riskassessment company pivx solutions warned that html objects embedded in web pages and email could carry code that allows an attacker to check out victims' cookie files, read their documents and execute programs on their computer. still another problem is plaguing outlook a popular plugin that lets users encrypt and digitally sign messages has inadvertently weakened security and left the mail program open to attack. security company eeye digital security issued a warning late wednesday to users of network associates' pretty good privacy (pgp) plugin for outlook, saying that a vulnerability in the addon could let attackers execute malicious software on a victim's computer. wifi everywhere, but not everyone one of the first cameras that can shuttle photos and videos using the wifi wireless networking technology has made its debut . iqinvision plans to sell the camera to companies such as security firms that need to put video cameras in places where wires can't go, or as a way to quickly install a temporary security system. this product is among the first devices to combine digital videography and wireless lans (local area networks) that use the wifi, or 802.11b, standard. expect more digital camera makers to follow suit. the number of digital cameras has been on the rise, and it's only a matter of time before a camera maker wants to add a popular new technology like wifi. wifi is also invading handheld devices . wireless equipment maker intersil is working with sychip to incorporate 802.11b wireless networking technology into a secure digital (sd) card for handheld devices. the card, which should be available to manufacturers for testing in the fourth quarter, lets handheld owners add and remove wireless networking capabilities to handhelds that contain an sd slot from palm, hewlettpackard and other companies. wireless sd cards would make it far easier for handheld manufacturers and owners to get these devices linked. only a few handhelds include wireless capabilities, and they are some of the most expensive on the market. with the card, wireless access becomes an option for many. not everyone is pleased with the explosion in popularity of wireless networking. broadband providers are cracking down on some customers, threatening to cut service to those who set up the inexpensive wireless systems and allow others to freely tap into their internet access. after being introduced just a couple of years ago, socalled wifi ""hot spots"" that tap into cable or digital subscriber lines (dsl) are now in at least 15 million homes and offices. the problem is that one paying subscriber can set up a local network that allows several other people to access the net, for fun or for profit. news.com special focus china as

lindowsos is presently available on lindowsos certified computers being offered from lindows.com  builder partners. the general release of lindowsos (available now for download and preview to lindows.com  insider partners) will be made available later this year for those wishing to install and run lindowsos on their existing computer hardware. the general release version will support a wider range of computer hardware and includes unique features such as a ""friendlyinstall"" alongside an existing microsoftr windows operating system, a streamlined installation process which requires no computer knowledge, and the ability to run a select set of ""bridge"" windowscompatible programs. for more information see  lindowsos and lindows.com are trademarks of lindows.com, inc. linuxr is a registered trademark of linus torvalds. microsoftr windowsr operating system is a registered trademark or service mark of the microsoft corporation. mm19  to change your mailing list options please go to","['http://support.lindows.com/', 'http://www.tryoutlinux.com/', 'http://www.lindows.com/warehouse', 'http://lindows.com/signup', 'http://lindows.com/mm', 'http://www.lindows.com/', 'http://www.lindows.com/gimp', 'http://www.lindows.com/walmart', 'http://www.lindows.com/openoffice', 'http://www.lindows.com/evolution', 'http://www.lindows.com/products', 'http://lindows.com/', 'http://www.lindows.com/lindows_products_lindowsos.php', 'http://www.lindows.com/openofficeflash', 'http://www.lindows.com/builder', 'http://www.lindows.com/flowchartpro', 'http://www.lindows.com/update']",5516,17,0,hard_ham_testing

(hint it's the same one that bled $2 billion in the past year.) even before the terror attacks, u.s. airways was an animal in pain. to all the usual industry troubles, add these fierce competition from discounters, a toosmall area of service concentrated on the east coast, and an unofficial battle with united airlines for the highest labor costs in the business. frustrated, the carrier tried to throw in the towel two years ago, reminded the washington post. in a bid to get bought by united, u.s. airways pleaded to federal antitrust regulators that it was too small to survive on its own. the feds disagreed and blocked the deal. now, of course, u.s. airways has a new flight plan. among those likely to get airsick shareholders, whose investment has vanished employees, many of whom are expected to lose their jobs, even though their unions have conceded hundreds of millions of dollars in pay and creditors, especially planeleasing companies, which will collect only as much as a bankruptcy judge approves. (where, by the way, is the reporter who will pick up the story of these leasing companies? not one creditor was named in any account we could find. yet before we soak our hankies over u.s. airways, we'd like to hear a word from the folks getting stiffed.) need a silver lining? check out the wall street journal, which observes that continental airlines ""soared to profitability"" thanks to its time in rehab a decade ago. we're guessing that anecdote is on the minds of texas pacific group, which is plunking down $200 million for twofifths of u.s. airways. texas pacific also played friend in need to continental  and pocketed 11 times its investment. meanwhile, it will be ""business as usual"" for u.s. airways customers, the company's chief assured a skeptical new york times. the airline will even continue to track and to honor frequentflier miles. better still cautious customers can use u.s. airways miles to book flights with its marketing partner, united. and, hey, according to an analyst quoted in the journal, there's at least a 20% chance that united won't be the next major carrier to announce it's gone broke.  lori patel us airways files for chapter 11 us airways announces bankruptcy shifts to cause rerouting of some booked fliers us airways files for bankruptcy protection us airways group, hit hard by terror, files for chapter 11 (paid subscription required.)  advertisement  you've heard about identity management, but do you know about the opportunities and business models that will emerge as a result? download a free executive summary of esther dyson's coverage of identity management in release 1.0. learn more about the expanding market for these services and applications.  remember global crossing?  followup has never been the media's strong suit. once stories fade from page one, so does reporters' interest. and in this summer of corporate scandals, remembering back to global crossing's january implosion and bankruptcy is akin to trying to recall the fuss over chads. the financial times pegged the company's bankruptcy sale friday a ""longawaited"" transaction, but few other outlets seemed to be holding their breath. the dearth of coverage is too bad, because the shock value of the numbers alone is worth attention, especially with enron and worldcom following behind it in the chapter 11 aisle. bankruptcy, it seems, means never having to say you're sorry. global crossing owed $12 billion when it filed for bankruptcy in january. its sale price? $250 million  and that's for only a nearly twothirds stake. sound too low? back in january, global crossing could have gotten much more, three times that much, and from the very same investment team, asian conglomerates hutchison whampoa and singapore technologies telemedia. but global crossing sniffed it was worth way more. now that it has discovered it's worth way less, here's how the deal carves up what's left of global crossing's pie, pending the regulatory approval that's expected in about six months. the two investors get a 61.5% stake bank creditors get 6%, and bondholders get about a onethird share. who's missing from the sliceanddice? shareholders, of course, who get nothing. the company is unapologetic, and creditors feel lucky for the crumbs. ""the reality is we could have done considerably worse,"" the wall street journal quoted edward weisenfelder, a lawyer for the creditors. as for the shrewd buyers, the financial times quoted hutchison's official statement that the deal would extend its telecom capabilities, particularly in its broadband service. but the wall street journal speculated that the company is simply buying low so it can sell higher. global crossing's turneddown offer of $750 million is approximately the same amount the company's founder, gary winnick, reaped in personal riches from the sale of his stock, as the journal noted in its pageone story on the telecom bandits. that's a lot of paper bits on any floor.  deborah asbrand hobbled global crossing accepts buyout bid from asian investors (paid subscription required.) buyers to pay $250 million for global crossing (ap) global crossing seals revival deal firms to buy majority of global crossing before telecom bubble burst, some insiders sold out stakes (paid subscription required.)  other stories  a bertelsmann heir jockeys to be heir apparent martha stewart likely to be subpoenaed us fraud law confuses europe's top companies race to tell aol time warner story creditors seek more worldcom data (wall street journal) interpretation of law could lead to ban on range of executive perks blockbuster fallout at netflix microsoft changes its tune toward linux spamming the world (newsweek)  do you want to reach the net's savviest audience? advertise in media unspun. contact erik vanderkolk for details at today.  staff  written by deborah asbrand keith dawson jen muehlbauer and lori patel copyedited by jim duffy advertising erik vanderkolk editor and publisher jimmy guterman media unspun is produced by the vineyard group inc. copyright 2002 media unspun, inc., and the vineyard group, inc. subscribe already, willya? redistribution by email is permitted as long as a link to is included.  powered by to be removed from this list, use this link to receive future messages in html format, use this link to change your subscriber information, use this link","['http://www.bayarea.com/mld/mercurynews/2002/08/10/business/3837152.htm', 'mailto:jimduffy86@yahoo.com', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/mod_input_proc.cfm?mod_name=tell_friend_form&XXDESXXuser=mediaunspun&XXDESXXthanks=Thank%20You%2E&XXDESXXsubject=Check%20this%20out%3A%20%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D&XXDESXXheading=&XXDESXXbackto=http://newsletter.mediaunspun.com/index000018838.cfm&XXDESXXissue_id=18838&XXDESXXtitle=M%20E%20D%20I%20A%20%20U%20N%20S%20P%20U%20N', '#a87133', '#a87131', 'mailto:dawson@world.std.com', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/change.cfm?x=mediaunspun%2Czzz-unspun@example.com%2Ctxt', 'http://guterman.com', 'http://pcg.fisherinvestments.com/newrespond/letter.asp?site=UNSP&KC=1229EFCAD0000', 'http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/134511508_linux12.html', 'http://www.imakenews.com/affiliate.cfm?a_id=unspun', 'http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1028898681279625080,00.html', 'mailto:dasbrand@world.std.com', 'mailto:guterman@vineyard.com', 'http://newsletter.mediaunspun.com', 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2183600.stm', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A6587-2002Aug11.html', 'http://release1.edventure.com/executivesummary.cfm?MCode=Unspun', '#a87132', 'http://www.salon.com/tech/wire/2002/08/11/stewart/index.html', 'http://tinyurl.com/zqj', 'http://www.msnbc.com/news/792924.asp', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/update.cfm?x=mediaunspun%2Czzz-unspun@example.com', 'http://www.imakenews.com', 'http://www.msnbc.com/news/792491.asp', 'http://www.mediaunspun.com/subscribe.html', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/12/business/media/12BOOK.html', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/remove.cfm?x=mediaunspun%2Czzz-unspun@example.com', 'http://www.latimes.com/news/printedition/front/la-fi-murky12aug12.story', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/12/technology/12ECOM.html', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/12/business/12CONS.html', 'mailto:jen@englishmajor.com', 'mailto:loripatel@hotmail.com', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A959-2002Aug9.html', 'http://www.mediaunspun.com', 'http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1029102020679872395.dzzz,00.html', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/12/business/12AIR.html', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/12/business/media/12BERT.html', 'mailto:erikvanderkolk@yahoo.com', 'http://abcnews.go.com/wire/Business/ap20020811_1301.html', 'http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1029103594827437995,00.html']",10677,41,0,hard_ham_testing

i haven't been by their website in quite some time, so when hal goldstein informed me of a new electronic delivery method that they've employed, i felt obligated to give it a spin. you can check out the september 2002 issue of the digital edition and see if you like reading the mag in that format better than the print variety. a software and accessories encyclopedia is also new to the site since my last belated visit. i've also been using my pocketpc quite a bit lately, but not for data. it's found a more frequent home on my belt as an mp3 player ever since diana's dad gave us a bicycle. going out for a morning ride has been quite pleasurable, and it's nice to bring along some tunes. i've tried both the compaq ipaq 3870 and hp jornada 565, and have been more pleased with the audio ability of the ipaq, due in part to the sound utility compaq provides to adjust treble and bass levels. it's just a more fullsounding device, in my opinion. see you in august , randy nieland gnomenetwork ldap whodunit pondered by warren dugas ""randy, a little question for you do you know what ldap is and how important it is to the world of technology? i'm sure you do  but where did it come from? hmm, let's put our thinking caps on and try to figure it out. did microsoft create it? hmm  no, how about novell? nope. well, who then?"" history of ldap x.500, the osi directory standard, defines a comprehensive directory service, including an information model, namespace, functional model, and authentication framework. x.500 also defines the directory access protocol (dap) used by clients to access the directory. dap is a full osi protocol that contains extensive functionality, much of which is not used by most applications. dap is significantly more complicated than the more prevalent tcpip stack implementations and requires more code and computing horsepower to run. the size and complexity of dap makes it difficult to run on thin clients, such as the pc and macintosh where tcpip functionality often comes with the machine. dap stack implementations are cumbersome to administer, thus limiting the acceptance of x.500. hence in 1993, the folks at university of michigan, with help from the isode consortium, designed and developed a protocol that would work over tcpip and was small enough when implemented to run on a thin client like pc's running the windows operating system or the macintosh. the ldap version 1 specification was published in march of 1994. the ldap version 2 specification was published as rfc 1777 by the access searching and indexing of directories (asid) working group in the ietf in march of 1995. in april of 1996, 40 companies including microsoft, netscape, and novell separately announced support for ldap protocol in their directory services products in order that they may in turn operate with each other and integrate with the internet. ldap version 3.0 has gone through several drafts but at this time is not finished. gnomesystem looking for sound suggested by corey hollett ""i've just gone on an extensive hunt for the best sound card and speaker set combination for 5.1 sound. my criteria were that it be excellent for games, music, and dvd playback. a price under $500.00 was also a strong point."" corey came to the same conclusion that others have in two respects. creative has long maintained a healthy share of the sound card market with a solid name and decent products. audiophiles know of other brands as well, such as turtle beach and philips, which also produce quality sound cards and at attractive price points. corey decided on the turtle beach santa cruz card, a great choice. his choice of speaker systems reinforced my own feelings on the subject. i own two klipsch speaker sets, the promedia 2.400 and most recently the promedia 5.1. the 2.400 system was the subject of many positive reviews, and believe me when i say that the promedia 5.1 leaves the 2.400 in the dust. the above review that corey pointed out hits the high points, and is actually quite indepth for an ""initial"" review. i'm itching to see if they eventually do write up a more complete version, as mentioned in the article.

mpeg4 isn't the only addition, joining a new aac audio codec that is a favorite among professionals. streaming media skip protection, flash 5 support and better applescript functionality also tag along. as always, there is a standard free version available for download, but the pro edition adds additional features, such as full screen video playback, the ability to create mpeg4 content and editing features not present in the free player. gnomestuff microtel  walmart love linux walmart is selling microtel pcs, but with a slight twist. they were one of the first manufacturers to preinstall lindowsos and offer systems to the retail market through walmart.com, and now mandrake is being offered as a pre installed choice in operating systems. these options give potential linux users an easier way to get started without having to build their own system from scratch or deal with driver issues, while still maintaining a low overall cost. a pentium 4 2ghz system with a cdrw drive goes for as little as $648 with mandrake linux, so not too shabby at all. recommend it! your subscribed email address is  to unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the

simple. download all you want  we'll definitely make more. in fact, we've found a way to get your products and services a little bit of unlimited promotion on the side, too. and who couldn't use a little more traffic nowadays? well, unless your data transfer bill is already sky high (which can happen when you get featured). it's all fun and games until someone's server falls to its knees. we're still sitting at 5 on amazon . if we ever hit 1, i'll eat my hat. and, mind you, this hat has been sitting around for quite a while it smells like feet. you'd have to eat three sombreros just to get the same amount of nutrition you'd get from my hat. you're better off just going for the free stuff, i suppose. the next time they ask ""do you care to super size that?"" you can respond, with dignity ""my funds are sufficient for the upgrade i avoided spending money on something that would have lasted longer, supported a helpful cause, and not have killed me earlier."" it makes sense  if you think about it. the fries aren't going to eat themselves. and if you don't eat the fries, who will?

yeah, i'm not even sure who i'll select for my provider. they currently use sbc to get online, so i might just stick with them for continuity's sake. verizon has been solid enough for me here, but i believe our loft complex has a unique infrastructure. if i could make contact with someone from any capable system, i'd probably go with them. i should probably get the ball rolling soon, though  i'd hate to play the waiting game for too long. i've heard of installation nightmares, so i'll probably be rolling my own (again). 56k is quaint, but hardly enough pipe to get any real work done. when you download as much as i do, every bit counts. oh, and did i tell you about the bites? there are plenty of unique restaurants in just about every direction. plus, we're right up around the corner from a peet's outlet! if you need me, you know where you can find me. i'll probably also be setting up a wifi network before too long, too. my proxim hardware still works, but i wasn't sure if i needed a crossover cable to connect it to my router. furo tells me ""if the hub has an uplink port, then a straight cable should work between the two, as it provides the crossover for you. if both have uplink and nonuplink ports (workstation attachment ports), then you would need a crossover cable between like ports. for instance, if you were connecting a workstation port on one to a workstation port on another, you'd have to use a crossover. same for uplink to uplink."" how's that for home network helpfulness?

pixel toolbox v1.1 3.7m w9x2kxp free make your own icons i have a compulsive habit of changing the original desktop and icons in windows to a version that mirrors my personality. so what happens if i can't find a desktop or set of icons that suits me? i load up pixel toolbox! this program allows me to flex my creative skills by creating windows icons and pointers. find yourself in a creativity slump? well, you don't have to strain your creative muscle. pixeltoolbox allows you to import an image that you already own, and work from there. if that isn't enough, you can fashion your own tiled desktop or share your creation with friends by exporting your masterpiece as a .jpg, .png, .tga, or .tif file. recommend it! gnomeclicks gnomesystem software audit protection program 2.9m w9x2kxp free you never pirate software, right? of course you don't! (good answer.) so, if someone came to your door and accused you of software piracy, could you prove them wrong? with the software audit protection program (sapp), you could. you can track every piece of software you own with this application you can attach an image of your paper receipt, add information like serial numbers and activation keys, etc., so you will never be left hunting for these items in the future. sapp can even create and print reports detailing your inventory. if you own a small company and want to make confirm that you and your employees are ""software compliant,"" this is the program for you. you can track your software using many different variables such as license, user id, software title or activation key. don't get caught secondguessing... be certain with the software audit protection program! recommend it! gnomewildcard print! v1.6 319k w9x2kxp us$39 unearthed by rob muller screen print utility time is money, and i endorse any program that can save me time. luckily, that is exactly what print! v1.6 does. say that i want to share screenshots with my other tech friends to compare error messages and talk about possible fixes every time i take a screen shot, i open up word, paste the snapshot, and then i can print it. too many steps, too much of my time! with print!, i just hit my ""print screen"" key and out comes my screenshot without involving any other programs. don't want a screenshot of your whole desktop? not a problem, just press alt  print screen and you'll have a printout of the active window only. print! 1.6 goes so far as to put the date and time on your printout too... perfect for saving those high scores on solitaire! other features include scaling, centering, and the ability to invert images. (so, not only will you save time, you'll also save on toner. bonus!) you may also want to note that print! saves your printer configuration without wreaking havoc on the settings in your other programs. you'll definitely get your money's worth with this program. don't believe me? start by checking out the evaluation version for yourself! submit your thoughts  recommend it! gnomefavorite remote access to your email  loudpc is a new product from loudfire enabling direct access to your pc's outlook(tm) from any internet browser or web phone. use loudpc to access your work email from home, check your next appointment while at lunch, reply to an important email while in a meeting, etc. no synchronization required. works with your existing email accounts. accesses all of your folders. all changes reflected immediately in your outlook(tm). get more info on loudpc bookcrossing bookclub gretchen is a selfprofessed pack rat there are just some things that she can't throw away. for example, books. i, on the other hand, prefer my text in an electronic medium, and don't really miss those analog versions. (what's that stuff called again? paper?) many of my books are gathering dust on the bookshelf. the alternative? free them into the wild! bookcrossing is essentially a worldwide book club. you register online and get a bookcrossing id number to put on your books with a note sending the new reader back to bookcrossing (think of wheresgeorge.com). then you just leave the book ""in the wild"" to be found by someone else the folks at bookcrossing suggest a park bench, the pocket of an airplane seat, or just plain giving your book to a friend. ""sounds easy, right? well it is. it's also a fascinating exercise in fate, karma, or whatever you want to call the chain of events that can occur between two or more lives and one piece of literature. oh, and we should mention, it's absolutely free and absolutely private, too."" bookcrossing also offers book reviews, ratings, and recommendations. recommend it! gnometip any modem that relies on windows to function is dubbed a ""winmodem."" most manufacturers use ""winmodems"" because they are cheap and easy to set up on a standard model pc. i don't have any problem with the manufacturer saving money (because living in a capitalistic society, i would hope that the savings would trickle down to me in one way or another). i do, however, have a problem with the way ""winmodems"" function after you add more internal devices to your pc. ""winmodems"" rely on windows to mediate their serial communication (io address, com port, irq, etc.) and as you can imagine, the more devices windows has to manage, the higher the probability of running into a problem. and what if you want to run linux instead? will the ""winmodem"" function well, if at all, in an operating system other than windows? don't bet on it! if you want to make sure you don't have any problems after upgrading your system, you'll want to get yourself a hardware modem. how can you determine this? checking a modem's system requirements. if the modem says it requires windows, then keep looking... you've found yourself a ""winmodem."" however, if the system requirements for the modem say that it will work with linux, then you've found yourself a hardware modem. yes, it is that easy. recommend it! your subscribed email address is  to unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription management page. for further information, please refer to the gnomecredits in the sidebar. look over here download our tip files latest windows daily latest digital media latest tech specialist latest penguin shell latest apple core latest web weekly latest bits  bytes find the lowest price suggest a feature advertise with us the gnomestore hightech job search chat with gnomies watch the webcams computer power user read past issues download xsetup about lockergnome our privacy policy view more options our xml  rss feed syndicate our tips link to lockergnome get chris's book tell a friend about us! general feedback email the editor the editor's blog search gnomespecials manage your workgroup form pilot say the time 5.0 boomer  stream now create webcd catalog easy web editor kleptomania tagrename pretty good solitaire visualize color combos firststop websearch ecobuilder book collector get listed here question which group is 250,000 strong and always looking for stuff to make their personal and professional lives run smoother?

opposed to every planet in the hoth system) and its moons. it also provides detailed information such as the planet's distance from the sun, its volume, mass, and gravity in relation to earth. what i

networking internet recruiting online branding popup menu navigation software scribbled by pat wong i found some really cool software to generate web site navigation menus, and i thought you might be interested in learning about it. there are several examples on the company's site, as well as on my own. here's a small writeup about it perhaps you'd be interested in running this in a future lockergnome issue? we've all seen a lot of really cool site navigation menus, with popup text, neat mouseover effects, and the like. most of them require a combination of html and javascript to build, which is expertise that goes way beyond some of us. at last, it's possible to easily generate just such a menu with some very userfriendly screens to enter the data you want to use. popup menu comes in a freeware version, or you can get a fully licensed version ($34.95 for a home user license  $129.95 for the web designer license). the biggest difference? with the licensed version, you get the ability to save a menu you've generated so you can modify it later. your only alternative, if you want to make even a simple change to a menu generated by the freeware version, is to create the whole menu again from scratch (or diving into the nuts and bolts of the code and modifying that). be forewarned the javascript reads like a novel, so modifying that could potentially be a nightmare. i decided to buy the fully licensed version and i'm really glad i did. sorry if i sound like a commercial for the company i don't work for them or stand to be compensated in any way for recommending them. i just think this menu system is the greatest thing to come along in a while. submit your thoughts  recommend it! avoid intruders in your online space our choice to protect your privacy!

credit card illegally, the owner of that card is responsible for the first $50. however, sometging that very few people know about is that there is a us federal provision in the banking industry called 'reg e' (regulation e  electronic funds transfer). this stipulates that all transactions will err in favor of the customer (account holder). this means that if your 'bank card' is used without your permission, you are not responsible for any of the charges. my suggestion is never to use a credit card  and only use your bank debit card. that way, if someone steals your number, you are not liable for any of the charges."" for more information, please refer to section 205 on federalreserve.gov. obviously, this tip only applies to people living in the usa. if you haven't been watching

break into the music video industry in this quirky comedy. john cusack and tim robbins make this comedy work, starring as the two security guards as they send up all sorts of hollywood stereotypes. you can't help but laugh at the ridiculous predicaments these two survive, as they are greeted with cameos by a who's who of music and movie industry names. i'm sure neither robbins nor cusack would openly list this movie on a resume, but it is indeed a brilliant performance by both of them, especially as a demonstration of their ability to play off of each other. although this is a late 80's release (one of the few 80's underground classics i hadn't previously seen), it remains relevant to those out there who are looking to put it to the man. if you've ever hated the recording industry and its incrowd attitude, you'll love this film. a closing reference to rene's courtyard cafe in santa monica, which is a regular stop for me every time i'm in the la area, prompted me to want to watch the film for a second viewing. the movie is humorous enough for several viewings. nothing really grabs attention on the dvd, but then again, the studio probably expects no one will buy it anyway. region 1 encoding (us and canada only) color, closed captioned, widescreen sound dolby digital 5.1 (english) audio commentary  bill fishman  director, michael nesmith  executive producer,

were to crack the file, they couldn't use the information on another machine. appsecure can also give your software shareware functionality such as number of days left, checking to see if the system

omaha has started a 10 year project on dodge street, which more or less divides the city in half east to west. the traffic tieups due to the construction disaster at 90th and dodge are being felt by nearby businesses. a bank is fighting back in a creative way, replacing random $20 and $10 bills in their atm machine with $50 and $20 notes respectively to reward lucky customers for their patronage. and i just drove right by the place. the route to des moines from waterloo isn't much better right now as they widen highway 33065 to 4 lane between marshalltown and des moines. once that's done, it will cut 2030 minutes from the trip, and judging from the progress they've been making, it won't be too much longer. that's probably the fastest moving highway construction i've seen during my travels throughout iowa over the years. as you travel to gnomedex from all manner of locales, be sure to keep tabs on construction at this handy site put up by the iowa department of transportation. see you in des moines , randy nieland gnomenetwork microsoft l2tpipsec vpn client microsoft l2tpipsec vpn client is a free download that allows computers running windows 98, windows millennium edition (me), or windows nt workstation 4.0 to use layer two tunneling protocol (l2tp) connections with internet protocol security (ipsec). the combination of l2tp and ipsec, known as l2tpipsec, is a highly secure technology for making remote access virtual private network (vpn) connections across public networks such as the internet. microsoft l2tpipsec vpn client also provides support for ipsec network address translator (nat) traversal. gnomesystem iomega intros 750mb zip i've all but ditched zip drive use entirely due to cost and small capacity. i know many people that still use zip drives, and i still play with a 1gb jaz drive from time to time, but with the ease and low cost of cdrw drives and media, zip just hasn't stood a chance. now that iomega has bumped the capacity to 750mb, employed usb 2.0 and pushed the speed of the drives significantly higher, maybe it's still worth a look for those that need a fast removable media option. i'll stick with cdrw myself. i'll sacrifice some speed for the reliability of optical media. but that's just me. gnomealertz today's top 5 kbalertz q241122  winup illegal operation or application error when clicking on product updates (q241122) q212713  wd2000 runtime error 5868 using vba macro to resize document window (q212713) q212723  wd2000 runtime error 5841 if style doesn't exist (q212723) q212722  wd2000 compile error if vba code doesn't find comments (q212722) q326537  offxp smart tags for names, telephone numbers, addresses, and stock symbols do not appear as expected (q326537) kill banners and popups dead banner zapper is a utility that automatically removes 100% of unsolicited popup ads with internet explorer (version 4.0 and above), any banner windows coming with free or lowcost services such as dialup internet access, and all popup ads with netscape navigator (all versions). version 3.0 enhances many of the functionalities from previous versions and includes additional special support for internet explorer. download your free trial now ! recommend it! gnomeassistant technical overview of .net file services .net server is more than windows 2000 with a look of windows xp, of that you can be sure. common sense has finally won, with the developers delivering many more command line tools to manage core services. of course, this isn't the only thing being brought to the .net table. improvements in dfs, defrag, chkdsk and efs just scratch the surface. new whql processes are being established for antivirus products, allowing them to hook directly into the os. virtual disk service, volume shadow copy service and promised improvements in the file replication service should make managing storage easier and more flexible. gnomestuff p4 performance goes to court a class action lawsuit has been filed in california by a small group of pc owners that are miffed about the performance, or lack thereof, that was promised by intel, hp and gateway. since the day the p4 was introduced, the overall performance has been criticized, so this would seem to be more an issue of failing to do proper due diligence on the part of the customer, if you ask me. this is one of those subjective questions that will come down to fancy lawyers and luck of the jury pool draw. if they believed everything the tv commercials had to say, then the litigants got what they had coming. one beer tastes better than the next, only one car can save your life in a crash, etc. this general lag in p4 muscle has been publicized since day one, as have crash test results on the part of the government and thirdparty organizations. should we be suing auto makers when someone dies in a 5star rated vehicle?

delay is generally defined as the time it takes from the instant you speak into the phone until the instant that sound is regenerated on the far end. quite a few things have to happen to transport this sound through the system, so delay actually has many components. read the entire tip here    don't miss these important messages and links   network managementvoipwireless strategies  searchnetworking searchnetworking.com hosts the networking decisions conference in chicago, october 1618. sessions focus not only on essential network management strategies, but feature critical insight on voip and wireless. you find out how to best prepare for these technologies now so you won't get left behind, the benefits to gainpitfalls to avoid, plus the real roi for your organization. get the full story right here  webcast archives  searchnetworking if you missed the original airing of our webcast on the best practices for availability and performance management with jon oltsik, don't fret, it's available for you to view at your leisure. and, while you're at it, take a look at all our previously aired webcasts, as well our upcoming live events. we're sure you'll find topics that interest you. view of archive on best practices for availability and performance management with jon oltsik view our upcoming events and webcast archive list here  networks of the future  searchnetworking featured topic last week we attended burton group's catalyst conference and heard all about the hottest trends in networking vpns, voip, wireless, identity management, and web services. read more about the issues surrounding each topic. click here for the current featured topic  expert advice ted studwell  voice over ip expert dear ted, where can we get information about inmarsat services?

""strong buy?"" pfffffft. in this lesson, we look specifically at signs that a company is slipping. investors need to remember one key point for highly valued companies, it only takes a small slip to lead to a large share price decline. for example, a company priced at a multiple of 30 times earnings is expected to grow faster than one that is priced at 15 times. as a result, investors in the highmultiple company are much more likely to be traumatized if its business starts to show slowing growth (in earnings, sales, cash flows, whatever). thus, with highly valued companies in particular, it's important to be vigilant in monitoring any slips. even a company that's growing nicely may be sending clear sell signals. so let's look at a few instances where companies have started to go wrong. our goal here is to learn how to recognize the warning signs of an impending stock collapse before it happens. warning sign 1 slowing sales growth through 2000, nokia (nyse nok) could do no wrong. it was one of the fastestgrowing stocks in the '90s and the largest, best capitalized participant in one of the hottest sectors of the market wireless telecommunications. in 2000, nokia posted revenue gains well in excess of 50% each quarter. then, in april 2001, it hit a clunker  22% growth, followed by 5% growth the next quarter. for investors in a highmultiple (high pe) company, this is rough. for most companies, a second quarter in a row of dramatically slowing sales is enough. get out. for a barnburner like nokia, one is enough. some words of wisdom keep companies in one of the hottest sectors on a very short leash. hot sectors cool off  they always do. remember, railroads were once the hot sector, then canals, car companies, radios, and so on. it ends. be ready. if you're expecting sales to continue roaring fullsteam ahead and they don't, it's time to position your finger on the sell trigger. if sales growth slows unexpectedly, be prepared to give a company one quarter to bring up its performance. but unload on the second straight quarter of slowing sales, measured on a yearoveryear basis. (always compare the quarterly growth on a yearoveryear basis  a comparison of sequential quarterly growth is a worthless measure. seasonal effects can skew sequential growth.) warning sign 2 divergent sales and profit growth by april 2001, nokia had shed some 60% of its peak value. signs were surely evident in advance, right? why, yes. companies growing top lines (sales) should generally be growing bottom lines (earnings) at a similar clip. even though nokia's sales were growing through 2000 at 50%plus per quarter, at the end of the year, net profit growth dropped suddenly from around 70% to 40%. profits recovered slightly in the fourth quarter, only to collapse in the first two quarters of 2001. the economics changed quickly, and with a hypergrowth company, the stock reacted just as fast. even those not deeply versed in the technology and economics of the mobile phone industry could see signs that something was wrong. warning sign 3 plummeting cash flows in 1999, lucent (nyse lu) looked beautiful from an earnings perspective, but horrible from a cash flow perspective. we look at two numbers operating cash flow and free cash flow. free cash flow can be low for growing companies, as they have significant capital investment demands, but low operating cash flow is inexcusable. lucent's experiences are telling. in 1999, lucent's fullyear earnings came out at a gaudy $4.7 billion, based upon $38 billion in revenue. the company was on top of the world, and it was, at the time, the largest telecommunications equipment company by market cap, at $260 billion. but as matt and i detailed in january 2000, big troubles were afoot, lurking in the company's cash flow statement. on an operating cash flow basis for fiscal 1999, the company lost $276 million. that's a far cry from the $4.7 billion in reported net income. and on top of that, lucent had more than $2.2 billion in capital expenditures. thus, the difference between lucent's earnings and its free cash flow (operating cash flow minus capital expenditures) was an amazing $7.3 billion, and not in a good way. the investor who picked up on this scary dichotomy could have saved herself losses in excess of 98%. (as an aside, since 1999, lucent has gone on to restate its 1999 cash flow not once, but twice, and in the most recent 10k, the 1999 operating cash flow is reported as a loss of $1.8 billion.) and get this  you'll see nearly the exact same thing on enron's old financial statements. cooked books or no, they weren't generating much cash. in fact, they were destroying it. warning sign 4 watch those bonds remember what we said about ignoring analysts? well, it's because their information can be quite conflicted, and it's almost impossible to tell if any one individual has your best interests in mind. fortunately, another group can give you the same type of signals investors who hold a company's bonds. bondholders buy a piece of a company's debt and are generally paid interest on this obligation by the company. watch the current price of a bond, and it will tell you the current odds bondholders are giving to that obligation being paid. i recommend keeping a log sheet where you write down the price of the bond. download it here. if you see a drop, the bondholders are growing pessimistic. you might even see this at the same time analysts are shouting, ""strong buy!"" i recommend the yahoo! bond center. you can search on any company and get a list of existing bonds. find a bond with a maturity between five and 10 years hence. check the price. a bond priced at 100 is at ""par,"" which means that the bond's facevalue interest rate fairly compensates the investor for the risk. some bonds are priced above 100, meaning the interest yield will be lower than face value. these are considered to be very low risk. but some are priced below face value, even way below. as of this writing, worldcom (nasdaq wcome) bonds are priced at 18, which means that bondholders assume there's little chance they'll be paid. tyco (nyse tyc), for all of its recent problems and high levels of debt, has 6.75% interest bonds, with 2011 maturity priced at 83. that's a discount to face, but not one that alludes to an imminent default. qwest (nyse q) sports a price of 85 on its 7.25% 2011 bonds, even closer to par than tyco. these prices don't indicate healthy companies, but they don't insinuate imminent default or bankruptcy either. warning sign 5 ""it just doesn't get any better"" for a brief time in 2000, cisco systems (nasdaq csco) was the largest company in the world by market capitalization. this should have been a warning. as i wrote in may 2000 when the stock was around $57, cisco's valuation of nearly $400 billion implied that investors expected the company's earnings to reach $34 billion in 2010. yet no company had ever generated earnings higher than $12 billion in a single year. as it turned out, i almost perfectly called the top for cisco  it has shed nearly $300 billion in market cap since that article. only those that decided it couldn't possibly get any better achieved a sale near the high watermark. cisco showed no signs of a decline. for the quarter that ended jan. 29, 2000, cisco turned in sales of $4.3 billion, as compared to $2.8 billion for the same quarter the year before  a growth rate of 53%. the following quarter was 58% higher, then 62% higher, then 66% higher. only cisco's stock price rise could beat these numbers. imagine a $385 billion company with a pe of 156! the assumptions for future growth were mindbending, though at the time, in the midst of the data revolution, they seemed plausible. as investors, we must be on the correct side of probabilities. taking a portion of our cisco investment off the table, at this point, would've been a smart choice. remember, cisco's business was fine in 2000, but the enterprising investor knows that a lot has to be right for the situation to work out. homework for this lesson, we ask you to do the same thing as we did after lesson 1. pick a company  maybe even the same company you looked at last time  to continue studying. for your company, do the following  track the yearoveryear sales growth for each of the past four quarters and three fiscal years. is growth accelerating, staying about the same, or weakening?  track the yearoveryear net income growth for each of the past four quarters and three fiscal years. is net income growing slower or faster than sales? is there a trend to these figures?  track your company's operating cash flow for each of the past three fiscal years. is it lower or higher than reported net income for the corresponding year? (we're not having you look at quarterly cash flow because those figures can bounce around due to the timing of payments. annual cash flow data is much more indicative of real cash flow trends.)  if your company has longterm debt, go the yahoo! bond center and check the price of your company's bonds. (if you don't know whether your company has any debt, just type your company name into the bond center and see if any debt shows up.)  finally, examine your company's market cap relative to its current net income over the past year. what's the pe ratio? is there reason to believe your company has every rosy scenario already priced into its stock? (in the current bear market, this is much less likely than it was a few years ago, but it's still a question you should consider.) to help you out, we've put together the foolish stock information form to track all of your research and information about your stocks. you can get to by clicking here. we've also outlined how to find all of the information above, here. so dust off the old calculator, find your company's financials, and get to work. quarterly financial data is best found in company 10qs, and annual data is best found in company 10ks. you should be able to find all of this information using financials from either the company website or at fool.com on the quotes  data area. feeling a little lost? if you're new to using sec filings, read this overview of financial statements. above all else, just do your best. once you've done what you can, report your findings to your teammates! we've also put together an ongoing list of resources so you can dive in a little deeper. you can click on the ""lesson resources"" link in the right column or click here to find more resources to help you better understand financial statements, general investing equations, and stock options. matt and i will be joining you on the boards with our own analyses, so you can examine our processes. fool on! bill and matt  lesson plan  lesson 1 on selling lesson 2 companies gone wrong lesson 3 gut checks and safety valves lesson 4 when a company becomes overvalued lesson 5 report card part 1  business prospects lesson 6 report card part 2  valuation lesson 7 panning for panera lesson 8 the report in action  johnson  johnson  this seminar contains the opinions and ideas of the motley fool. it is provided with the understanding that the motley fool is not engaged in rendering financial or other professional services. the motley fool specifically disclaims any responsibility for any liability, loss, or risk, personal or otherwise, which is incurred as a consequence, directly or indirectly, of the use and application of any of the contents of this seminar. copyright (c) 19952002 the motley fool. all rights reserved. legal information","['http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690020', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690016', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690029', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690041', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690039', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690032', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690024', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690013', 'http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690021', 'http://boards.fool.com/Boards.asp?fid=10075', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690038', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690046', 'http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690019', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690014', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690034', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690035', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690017', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690023', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690033', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690025', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690018', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690026', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690030', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690042', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690015', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690022', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690044', 'http://www.lnksrv.com/m.asp?i=690043', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690045', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690031', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690012', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690040', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690036', 'http://www.fool.com/m.asp?i=690037']",14214,34,0,hard_ham_testing

week in review harvest at macworld search news.com all cnet the web live tech help now! april's tech award 1 million open jobs news.com top cios zdnet peoplesoft cnet  news.com week in review the entire tech week in a single email saturday, july 20, 2002 mac fans flocked to the macworld expo in new york to watch apple computer trot out new hardware, software and even a web services planbut it might be a challenge getting people to pay for the offerings. apple ceo steve jobs kicked off the trade show by unveiling new ipod digitalaudio players and a new flatpanel imac. the new ipod players include models built specifically for computers that use microsoft's windows operating system. apple lowered the price of the existing 5gb ipod and a redesigned 10gb model, which is thinner and comes with a new case and remote control. jobs also introduced a beefier 20gb ipod for $499. the ipod stable now includes three models for mac users and three models for windows users with musicmatch software. as expected, jobs introduced a new imac model with a 17inch flatpanel monitor. the model offers a widescreen display with 1,440by900pixel resolution versus 1,024by768pixel resolution for the 15inch imac. jobs also previewed the next version of mac os x, version 10.2, which will be on store shelves aug. 24 for $129. os x 10.2 includes a new finder with improved search features, springloaded folders and the ability to change the background photo as often as every 5 seconds. but fans who rushed to os x last year learned there's no such thing as a cheap upgrade when the company announced it will not offer a discounted upgrade version of mac os x version 10.2, codenamed jaguar, to current users of the operating system. to get jaguar, current os x users will have to buy a new macintosh or an entirely new version of the operating system for the retail price of $129. apple's decision not to sell a lessexpensive upgrade version lay in the qualitative difference between version 10.1 and 10.2. although the versions share the same core technology, jaguar includes several new features and services, such as search tool sherlock 3 and internet address finder rendezvous, which arguably classify it as an entirely new piece of software. apple also raised eyebrows by transitioning its itools web services from a free program to a paid program called .mac. the company plans to charge about $100 per year for the program. the collection of web services was launched about three years ago, and now includes online storage via a service called idisk, online greeting cards through icards and other features. despite itool's popularity, the company may face a tough sell with the .mac program. the history of paid services, is not a pretty picture. customers have bristled when companies try to slap charges on previously free services. some have succeeded but many have struggled, especially when free alternatives lurked elsewhere. in the early 1990s, apple's efforts to form online communities and popularize search engines failed magnificently. to its advantage, apple has presented a fairly coherent and tangible set of services with .mac. and although its software division is far more organized than it once was, it's unclear how overwhelming demand will be. however, an online petition protesting the new charges doesn't bode well for the program. microsoft's moves not one to be caught in anyone's shadow, microsoft plans to offer a rebate for its office suite for mac os x to those who buy the software bundle when they pick up a new mac. the promotion entails a $50 mailin rebate for people buying a new mac and upgrading to office v. x, and $100 for those buying a mac and the full version of the software. the offers come after microsoft revealed that sales of the software have not met its expectations. the software potentate had expected to sell 750,000 copies of office v. x by now, but instead has sold only 300,000 since the program went on sale last november. microsoft is also putting the finishing touches on the third collection of windows 2000 bug fixes, which is nearly ready for release after a protracted period of testing. the update, windows 2000 service pack 3, contains vital security updates and hundreds of fixes to bugs plaguing the operating system that microsoft released in february 2000. service pack 3 could be important for many businesses, as not all of the included security fixes are available as separate downloads. not everything will be available as a download, however. weeks before microsoft plans to reinstate java in windows xp, it has shut down a site that would automatically send its java software to windows xp users. the company closed the installondemand feature 30 days after it told java inventor sun microsystems it would reinstate java in windows xp through the forthcoming service pack 1 but remove it altogether in 2004. somebody's watching you you better watch what you write in yahoo's free email servicebecause yahoo is. to protect users from malicious code, yahoo uses an automated filter to swap out a handful of words such as ""mocha"" and ""eval"" that pertain to web code known as javascript. the reason is that email sent in a form known as ""web enhanced"" can contain javascript instructions able to run programs on the recipient's pc. javascript is a web language that

""mocha"" is one of those special commands that can be run from webenhanced email. typing ""mocha"" into the location bar of the netscape browser will open a screen with a display area and a text box underneath, in which commands can be entered. a malicious hacker could, for example, use the command line to run a program that changes a person's password without that person's knowledge. on the heels of plans for new powers to patrol people's web use, the u.s. government is again turning to technology to monitor suspicious activity in the name of fighting terrorism. the government has unveiled more details of its terrorist information and prevention system (tips), a plan to recruit volunteers across the country who will keep tabs on dubious or suspicious behavior.

""quickalendar gives you quick and easy access to a calendar whenever you need it. you can view the calendar on screen, or print it out to jot down notes and appointments."" you need to keep in mind that the print feature is relative to how you have quickalendar displayed on your machine. if you are in full screen mode, then the printout will be bigger than a standard sheet of letter paper. if you try printing in normal view, then the printout will be too small to write on. my suggestion is to play with the size of quickalendar's screen until you get a printout that you can be proud of. now, you'll have no reason to be late for gnomedex! diatris v1.0 407k w9x2kxp free tetrislike game i've always been fascinated with geometric shapes. to me everything has to be somewhat symmetrical... even my hair! so it was no wonder why i was addicted to playing the game tetris for so many years. the only problem with tetris is that, after awhile, it starts to get a little too easy. diatris is a bundle of three different  and much more challenging  tetrislike games. ""for the first game, ydiatris, the objects can move vertically and diagonally. the second game, xdiatris, the objects can move only in two diagonal directions the vertical drop is taken out. for the last game hdiatris the objects can only move vertically and horizontally like most block drop games."" i won't kid you, these games can be pretty hard, but if you are a tetris fan, then these set of games are for you. if you're not a tetris fan, don't worry, there are a few other games you might like on this site, so check it out! recommend it! gnomeclicks gnomesystem how to troubleshoot issues with reading cds disc device troubleshooting ""this article describes how you can troubleshoot issues reading cdrom or dvdrom optical discs. this article also discusses how to troubleshoot common issues with cdr and cdrw devices. the steps in this article apply to compact disc (cdrom) drives, compact disc recordable (cdr) drives, compact disc rewritable (cdrw) drives, and digital video disc (dvd) drives."" to summarize, you should try the steps on this site before calling your technical support. some of the steps include closing unnecessary software, testing the disc in a different computer, and cleaning the disc. make sure to clean a disc by wiping from the center of the disc outward... if you wipe the disc in a circular fashion, then you risk scratching it. the steps in this article will only serve to save you time, as you will probably be able to fix most disc problems by following the steps. if this article doesn't help you resolve your disc problem, look on the bright side... you won't have to spend so much time on the phone with technical support, because you'll already know what the problem isn't! recommend it! gnomewildcard modem spy v3.1.3b 230k w9x2kxp $25 unearthed by sergei polishchuk answering machine ""modem spy is a handy utility for phone calls recording. features 1) records phone conversations. 2) records from microphone. 3) plays back recorded messages via phone line. 4) plays back recorded messages via sound card. 5) can record all incoming phone calls. 6) has builtin software automatic gain control. 7) detects and logs caller id."" gnomie brian stevens tried this one out for us, but had a small problem testing this on any of his machines... he doesn't have any modems! brian says, ""i was able to load the program, though, and try a few of the features out. you can record an audio memo to your machine, much like an answering machine. you can also email this audio memo, although i don't recommend you do that as the wav file didn't seem to play well when i tried emailing it to myself (which may have been due to the microphone it was recorded with). other than that, modem spy is a solid program and is a great alternative to buying a traditional answering machine... plus in most cases it is cheaper!"" keep in mind that, for caller id to work, you need the caller id service turned on by your phone service provider. submit your thoughts  recommend it! gnomefavorite get highspeed access verizon online dsl is an affordable, highspeed internet connection. click here to see if verizon online dsl is available in your area. the avocado papers unearthed by meryl evans after surfing serious web site upon serious web site, you just need to find a site where you can relax and have a good time. theavocadopapers.com is one of those sites that is a little bit goofy but extremely creative. it isn't that the web site is really about anything there is some creative writing (usually rather funny) and the occasional interview (this week ""steve schneider interviews himself""). if you are a little bit nosy, and want to peek into the lives of others, you can read ron bork's diary or enter the avocado chat. although the makers of the web site don't even know what it is about, i think it is quite apparent... fun! go check out the web site for yourself and see if you can pin down its rhyme or reason. worstcase scenario, you can always sign up for their current promotion... free linguine! recommend it! gnometip this tip is for the windows xp users out there. ""the windows xp operating system achieves excellent performance in part by dynamic adjustments that it makes in response to how a system is utilized. in particular, many adjustments are made when the system first runs following setup and when newly installed applications are used for the first time. these adjustments greatly influence the performance of the system. unfortunately, the dynamic nature of windows xp can make benchmarking more of a challenge than with previous windows versions."" to properly benchmark your windows xp system, there are a few steps you should follow. the step with which we are concerned in this particular tip is letting your pc process any ""idle tasks."" idle tasks are tasks that your pc executes when it deems the system to be unused or idle. some of these include file placement optimization, system restore, and doneonceaftersetup work items. ""all of these 'idle tasks' are controllable by a system api in advapi32.dll, processidletasks. the api's sole purpose is to allow benchmarks a simple way to force any pending idle tasks to be executed immediately, without having to wait a lengthy period of time. to call processidletasks from the command line, use this syntax rundll32.exe advapi32.dll,processidletasks."" once running, it may take up to around 15 minutes to process all of the idle tasks, and your hard drive will be active through most of it. for more steps on preparing your windows xp machine for benchmarking, head over to the windows platform development page on benchmarking for windows xp on microsoft's site. recommend it! your subscribed email address is  to unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription management page. for further information, please refer to the gnomecredits in the sidebar. look over here download our tip files latest windows daily latest digital media latest tech specialist latest penguin shell latest apple core latest web weekly latest bits  bytes find the lowest price suggest a feature advertise with us the gnomestore hightech job search chat with gnomies watch the webcams computer power user read past issues download xsetup about lockergnome our privacy policy view more options our xml  rss feed syndicate our tips link to lockergnome get chris's book tell a friend about us! general feedback email the editor the editor's blog search gnomespecials manage your workgroup form pilot say the time 5.0 boomer  stream now create webcd catalog easy web editor kleptomania tagrename pretty good solitaire visualize color combos firststop websearch ecobuilder book collector get listed here question which group is 250,000 strong and always looking for stuff to make their personal and professional lives run smoother?

inaugural guru week dan wahlin expounds on xml support in asp.net asptoday are proud to announce their first guru week. from 29th july to 2nd august microsoft mvp, asptoday author and founder dan wahlin presents a series of specially commissioned articles, telling you all you need to know about xml support in asp.net. drawing on his experience of consulting and xml training, dan's articles will allow anyone interested in xml to quickly get up to speed in this important subject. read more about asptoday's guru weeks updating data safely with a dataset, by alex homer ok, so we cant store all three values for a row (the current, original and the underlying values) in the tables of our dataset. is this actually important? what do we actually need to perform the process, and what do users actually expect to see? can we make do with just two values instead of three, (and dont you hate books that keep asking questions)? read the rest of alex homer's article here  wrox announcements  author interviews with franois liger, craig mcqueen and paul wilton, authors of visual basic .net text manipulation handbook. ap what do you think this book brings to the visual basic .net developer, and so who do you think needs this book? cm the book provides a quick easy reference for string programming tasks. string manipulation is a large part of programming and it is difficult to remember it all. having an accessible reference assists in finding existing code to do the job rather than rewriting something that is already in the platform. it's valuable for all .net developers. pw i think all vb.net developers need this book. string handling and regular expressions are not arcane topics for highflying gurus  they are the stuff of everyday programming! the regular expression chapters give a great insight into what at first can seem a tricky topic. in addition the regular expression reference at the back of the book is worth its weight in gold  certainly more readable than all the documentation i had to work with when writing the book. ap in two sentences, explain what strings are in .net. read the interview in full or read about visual basic .net text manipulation handbook with tobin titus, author of visual basic .net threading handbook in june, wrox brought out a slim 260page volume on threading in vb.net. there has been some confusion as to why we would want to bring a book out on what seems a straightforward topic. in this article we interview tobin titus (one of the authors on this title) and ask him various questions on the book, as well getting his opinions on various programmingrelated topics. what is free threading? free threading is the ability to control execution to the utmost within an application. while vb developers have been able to control some aspects of threading in the past, they haven't been completely free to control those threads in the manner that they desire. free threading allows the developer to make decisions on when a thread should start, when it should end, and what it should do while executing. read the interview in full here or read about visual basic .net threading handbook ctoday free code download due to customer feedback, ctoday have decided to try out something new this week  we are making this week's code download  support material available to all nonsubscribers (providing they are a member of the wrox developer community, which is free to join). this week's case study generating design patterns using codedom the code document model (codedom), which provides the ability to generate source code in a number of the managed languages, is a very powerful .net facility and has attracted much interest. within visual studio .net, a complementary though unrelated feature is provided by the codemodel object, which allows programmatic access to handwritten code. together these two tools provide a platform from which it should be possible to develop a vs.net addin to streamline the production of common designs in code. this case study follows the development of such a tool, which attempts to automate the generation of a widespread design pattern in an existing c or vb.net project. get on the fast track to success if you are an experienced programmer who needs to get up to speed on core .net technologies as quickly as possible, the fast track series is for you. the fast track books complement our beginning and professional series by providing concise guides to core topics. they deliver the essential facts and understanding that are required to start taking advantage of .net. by targeting specific groups of experienced developers, the books are able to concentrate on providing valuable information rather than covering basics. read the full article here  information for

use ctrll to clear it. this does the same thing as the clear command with far fewer keystrokes. do you want to log out of the console screen quickly? use the ctrld key combination. this will log out the current user. if you're using bash and the current user is not root, the ctrld combination will close the terminal window, as well. to me, any opportunity to save keystrokes is a good one. better yet, if i can avoid having to take my fingers from the keyboard to reach for the mouse, then i've really saved some time. though it's tough to quantify the time savings using these keystroke combination shortcuts, intuitively i can tell you it's substantial. maximum efficiency. that's what tweaks are all about. recommend it! send us a gnometweak gnomecore kernel configuration  part xi we've covered some fairly light topics to this point in the kernel configuration series. today's topic requires a bit of review. we'll discuss configuring block devices in your kernel. we've talked about the different types of devices in previous penguin shell issues. fundamentally, the two that you'll deal with the most are block and character devices. these draw their type names from the way they handle data. block devices receive data for storage in chunks, generally preset sizes of data ""blocks."" hard drives are block devices. they'll only write chunks of data to storage. thus, the problem with shutting down your machine uncleanly. data intended for storage may not, in fact, have been written at the time your power dies or you hard kill your machine. the system may still be accumulating data up to the proper block size before committing it to the hard drive. character devices, on the other hand, receive data in ""streams,"" one character at a time. serial ports are a great example of character devices. they handle data input and output on the fly, rather than filling a buffer then committing the data. the physical nature of these device types goes a long way toward explaining why they handle data as they do. a hard drive has to physically spin up to store or retrieve data. you're actually changing the magnetic properties of the disc surface when you store data. consequently, a hard drive has to know where there's free space on the disc surface, has to move that area of the disc under the write head and try, as best it can, to group blocks of related data together. character devices really don't store data as much as they send it off and forget about it. the process is purely electrical rather than electrical and physical. the serial port, for example, sends data in a stream to your palm pilot. the storage of the data is actually handled by the palm itself, not a physical storage device on the computer. there's no need to spin up a drive and account for the data as is necessary with a hard drive. the palm will also send a signal back to the computer confirming receipt of data. that's an indication that character devices often communicate in both directions, as well. so, when you're configuring block devices in your kernel, you're preparing the system for communicating with a device that will buffer data to a predetermined level, then write that data as a block, changing the physical properties of the hard drive disc surface. even though that's the highest level view of the process, it still shows how difficult a process physical data storage really is. in the block device section, you'll find many options for physical data storage. when configuring this section, it's crucial to know as much about your existing hardware as possible. what type (brand) of hard drives are you using? what's the interface to the machine  ide, parallel, etc? where is the drive located  on the local machine or on a networkconnected box? because the variables are so broad, it's nearly impossible to give you a stock configuration tip that will work for your personal machine every time. i can tell you this  you will have block devices (normally a hard drive and a floppy), and you need to answer as many of the above questions as you can. find out as much about these physical devices as you can, and the configuration process will be relatively painless. a warning  you'll see more configuration tips like this as the series continues to progress. i'll certainly make handson configuration recommendations where possible. there are quite a few areas where i can make such recommendations. however, where the variable set is as broad as block devices, much of the legwork will be up to you. tomorrow, we'll talk about raid and multidevice support in linux. recommend it! send us a gnomecore tip gnomefile rxlinux ""the concept behind rxlinux is to centralise configuration and management of multiple linux servers. new servers can be deployed in minutes. a web interface is used to build custom iso cdroms dedicated for specific servers. servers, also called rxnodes, boot up from that cdrom and get the rest of the configuration and software from a master server. no administration is done directly on the nodes everything is controlled from the master servers. when the rxnode has finished booting up and all software is running, it is completely independent from the rxmaster until the next reboot."" recommend it! send us a gnomefile suggestion gnomevoice penguin hearts scribbled by karl steenblik ""i can not believe all of the help your posting to the linux community has generated. i have had over 20 offers for help. some of the offers would not fit our space needs but that number of responses shows that linux people care.

of time trying to understand its xscale processor. a benchmark provided by intel seems to indicate that it performs certain operations faster than previous pocket pcs, but in handson use we didn't find any significant difference in performance. i'm still not certain whether i should attribute performance limitation to the operating system (which hasn't been optimized for the new chips), applications (which likewise haven't be optimized), or simply that the new chip isn't that much better than the old strongarm. but regardless, the e740 is an exceptional pocket pc and one i don't

the multidevice support section of the kernel configuration will allow you to do this. in fact, you'll be able to set the raid level, as well. again, evaluate your needs and select the appropriate option. tomorrow, it's on to networking options in your kernel configuration. recommend it! send us a gnomecore tip gnomefile savemymodem ""savemymodem is an antispam, mailshaping, and deleteonserver mail tool. it is designed for users with slow dialup connections, who are tired of downloading large amounts of spam and worm and virus attachments."" recommend it! send us a gnomefile suggestion gnomevoice windows apps in linux?

""each time a filesharing service is canceled, a bunch of new ones appear."" but some people always find a silver lining. ""i might use a filesharing service for a lot of things, particularly drivers, fixes, and patches."" a p2p network offering drivers seems like a great idea to me. ""i was an occasional audiogalaxy participant (birthday cd burned to include songs that were hits the year you were born). now i'll just opt for a birthday card and a bottle of wine."" i included this comment because i really like the birthday idea. ""it seems once again rather than release a file download site for music, at a fee per download, the music companies spend money on trying to stop download sites like audiogalaxy."" with its popularity, file swapping should be an amazing opportunity for record companies, but they must not be smart enough to figure out how to make it work. the email address for your subscription is

the honorable michael k. powell chairman federal communications commission 445 12th street, s.w. suite 8c453 washington, dc 20554 by facsimile, electronic mail, and postal mail dear chairman powell i am writing to you today in regards to the digital television broadcast flag specifically, i write in response to sen. hollings' and representatives dingell and tauzin's letters of july 19, which urged you to mandate the broadcast flag proposal outlined in the final report of the broadcast protection discussion group. the electronic frontier foundation (eff) is a donorsupported nonprofit organization that works to uphold civil liberties interests in technology policy and law. eff has played a critical role in safeguarding crucial freedoms related to computers, the internet and consumer electronics devices, defeating the restriction on strong cryptography exports securing the legal principle that internet wiretaps must only proceed in conjunction with a warrant and defending academics, researchers and commercial interests against dmcarelated prosecution. eff was an active participant in the broadcast protection discussion group. we attended the group's meetings and conference calls and participated in the group's policy and technical mailinglists. eff also maintains a website that was and is the only public source of information on the broadcast flag negotiations and proposal. the site can be found at eff devoted thousands of staffhours to publicizing the existence and nature of the bpdg to the public, to civil liberties and consumeradvocacy groups, and to entrepreneurial companies and software authors whose products were threatened by the proceedings. when you and i met at esther dyson's pc forum last march, we spoke briefly about the civil liberties interests that would be undermined by the broadcast protection discussion group's mandate. the bpdg proposal will have grave consequences for innovation, free expression, competition and consumer interests. worst of all, it will add unnecessary complexity and expense to the dtv transition, compromising dtv adoption itself. as you are aware, technologists have traditionally manufactured those devices they believed would be successful in the market, often in spite of the misgivings of rightsholders. from the piano roll to the pvr, technologists have enjoyed the freedom to ship whatever products they believe the public will pay for what's more, innovation has always thrived best where there were the fewest regulatory hurdles. ntsc tuners and devices are governed by precious few regulations, and consequently we see a rich field of products that interact with them, from the vcr plus to tunercards for pcs to the pvr. the broadcast flag proposal would limit technologists to shipping those products that met with the approval of mpaa member companies. no entrepreneur or software author will know, a priori, whether his innovative dtv product will be legal in the market until he has gone to the expense of building it and taking it around to the hollywood studios for review. consumers and industry alike have benefitted greatly from the ""open source"" or ""free software"" movement, in which technologies are distributed in a form that encourages enduser modification. from serversoftware like the webwide successstory apache, to operating systems like gnulinux, to consumer applications like the mozilla browser, free software is a powerful force for innovation, consumer benefit and commercial activity. the bpdg proposal implicitly bans free software dtv applications  such as the dscaler deinterlacer and the gnu radio softwaredefined radio program  as these applications are built to be modified by endusers, something that is banned under the bpdg proposal. the tamperresistance component of the bpdg's ""robustness requirements"" will create and entire class of illegal software applications, abridging the traditional first amendment freedom enjoyed by software authors who create expressive speech in code form under one of several free softwareopen source licenses. the bpdg nominally set out to create an objective standard, a bright line that technologists could hew to in order to avoid liability when deploying their products. however, the end product of the bpdg was a ""standard"" that contained no objective criteria for legal technology rather, the standard required that new technologies be approved by mpaa member companies. not uncoincidentally, the only technologies that were approved by the mpaa  and hence the only legal technologies  were those produced by the 4c and 5c consortia, a group of technology companies that acted as the mpaa's allies throughout the bpdg process. this is an harbinger of the sort of regime that the bpdg standard will usher in technology companies will be able to shut their competitors out of the marketplace by allying themselves with hollywood, brokering deals to allow certain technologies and outlaw others. the marketplace is a proven mechanism for rapidly and efficiently producing products that increase the value and desirability of new technologies, such as dtv. a bpdg mandate would subvert the market for dtv innovation. competing companies with lowercost dtv technology alternatives would be restrained from bringing these to market if they failed to assuage the mpaa's concerns about unauthorized redistribution. furthermore, the universe of unauthorizedbutlawful uses for dtv programming will be shrunk down to the much smaller space of explicitly authorized uses. the ability of the public to make unauthorizedbutlawful uses of television programming has been an historical force for increasing the value of broadcast programming, from the vcr to the pvr. ironically, the inevitable damage that a broadcast flag mandate would do to innovation, competition and consumer interests can only slow down dtv adoption, by driving up the cost of dtv devices while reducing the number of desirable features that an open market would create. if the public is offered less functionality for more money, they will not flock to dtv. the most disheartening thing about the broadcast flag is that there is neither a strong case that the broadcast flag is a necessary tool for protecting copyright, nor that the broadcast flag would be effective in that role. the existing practice of internet infringement of broadcast programming  analog captures from devices that satisfy the requirements of the bpdg proposal  would not be stopped by the presence of a broadcast flag. higherresolution dtv signals will likewise present no challenge to determined infringers, who can capture fullquality analog signal from dtv devices and then redigitize them, suffering only a single generation's worth of lossofquality before the programming enters the internet. meanwhile, the underlying rubric for a broadcast flag  that infringement will undermine hollywood's business to the point that movies will no longer be available to the public, reducing the value of dtv  is no more than superstition. no credible study or analysis, undertaken by a neutral party, has ever been presented to congress, the fcc, the cptwg or the bpdg supporting this notion. the public is being asked to sacrifice its rights in copyright industry is being asked to place its right to innovation in the hands of entertainers the us government is being asked to mandate extraordinary, unprecedented regulation of the $600 billion technology sector  all on the uncorroborated opinions of a few studio executives. eff welcomes the fcc's oversight of the broadcast flag issue. the bpdg proceedings took place behind a shroud of secrecy, in a lookingglass ""public process"" where only those participants the organizers wanted to hear from were made privy to its existence, where the cochairs invented rules and processes on the fly to suit the needs of the entertainment interests and the technology companies that had privately secured a promise of a legal monopoly for their products, where the press was banned. the fcc has an admirable tradition of seeking and weighing public opinion in its proceedings. as the fcc considers the broadcast flag, eff hopes that it will start anew, setting aside the findings of the bpdg in light of the concerns raised by microsoft, philips, sharp, thomson, and zenith, as well as nonprofit organizations including eff, consumers union, consumer federation of america, the free software foundation, public knowledge, digitalconsumer.org, the center for democracy in technology, and the computer and communications industry association. thank you for attention in this matter. please let me know if we can be of any further assistance to you. sincerely yours, cory doctorow for the electronic frontier foundation links eff's bpdg blog an overview of our concerns with the broadcast flag letter from sen. hollings letter from rep. tauzin   update on intel corp. v. hamidi intel corp. v. hamidi is now on appeal to the california supreme court. eff filed an amicus brief in support of ken hamidi on aug. 6, 2002. the facts are simple over about two years, hamidi on six occasions sent email critical of intel's employment practices to between 8,000 and 35,000 intel employees. intel demanded that hamidi stop, but he refused. intel obtained an injunction barring hamidi from emailing intel employees at their intel email addresses, based on the commonlaw tort of ""trespass to chattels."" (""chattel"" is a legal term that refers to personal property, as opposed to property in land.) eff's amicus brief argues three main points. (1) intel did not qualify for relief under ""trespass to chattels"" because intel's email servers were not themselves harmed by hamidi's emails. if intel was harmed, it was because the content of hamidi's emails affected intel employees, not because sending the emails affected the functioning of intel's servers. (2) by focusing on unwanted ""contact"" with the chattel and ignoring the harm requirement, the court of appeal turned ""trespass to chattels"" into a doctrine that threatens common internet activity like search engines and linking. for example, if a website posted a ""no trespassing"" sign, any ""contact"" by a search engine could be considered a trespass even if it caused no harm. (3) the court of appeal wrongly held that the injunction did not infringe hamidi's freedom of speech. the first amendment limits private parties' legal remedies in many areas of law, such as libel, out of concern that private parties will use the law to suppress criticism. the same principle should apply here, where intel's claims of harm stem from the meaning of hamidi's speech. links the intel v. hamidi archive  end    decss author johansen's trial rescheduled the trial of norwegian teen jon johansen, who created the controversial decss software, has been pushed back again. it is now scheduled to be heard on december 9, 2002, in oslo, norway. in the fall of 1999, johansen and his team reverseengineered the content scrambling system (css) software used to encrypt dvds in an effort to build a dvd player for the linux operating system. in january of 2002, the norwegian economic crime unit (okokrim) charged johansen with a violation of norwegian criminal code section 145.2, which outlaws breaking into a thirdparty's property in order to steal data that one is not entitled to. this prosecution marks the first time the law will be used to prosecute a person for accessing his own property (his own dvd). johansen faces two years in prison if convicted. the prosecution is based on a formal complaint filed by the motion picture association. the trial had originally been scheduled to take place in june of 2002 but was rescheduled when the court could not find any qualified judges to hear johansen's case. now the case is scheduled to be heard by a threejudge panel. help jon in his battle against hollywood movie studios, donate to his legal defense fund at links the decssjohansen archive digital rights management archive  end    bunnie presents paper on xbox reverse engineering paper explains flaw in videogame security system researcher escapes chilling effect of digital copyright law electronic frontier foundation media advisory for immediate release thursday, august 9, 2002 san francisco  the electronic frontier foundation (eff) is pleased to announce that former mit doctoral student andrew ""bunnie"" huang will present a paper explaining a security flaw in the microsoft xbox (tm) videogame system. huang will present his paper, ""keeping secrets in hardware the microsoft xbox case study,"" at 525 p.m. pdt on august 13, 2002, at the 2002 workshop on cryptographic hardware and embedded systems (ches 2002) in redwood city, california (aug. 1315, 2002). the xbox security system is intended to allow people to play only videogames authorized by microsoft. huang's paper ""shows how a person could defeat that system with a small hardware investment,"" said mit professor hal abelson, one of huang's advisors. ""more importantly, the paper relates the security vulnerability to a general design flaw shared by other highprofile security systems such as the government's clipper chip and the movie industry's contents scrambling system (css) for dvd players."" huang contacted eff in march after his advisors told him that his preliminary findings raised potentially significant legal questions. with the help of boston college law professor joe liu, eff worked with huang, abelson, and mit administrators to analyze the legal issues and draft letters notifying microsoft of huang's research findings and intended publication, one of the steps encouraged by digital millennium copyright act (dmca). microsoft told huang and abelson that while it might prefer that the paper not be published, it would be inappropriate to ask mit to withhold the paper. ""microsoft deserves praise for making no attempt to control publication,"" said abelson. ""their response shows that they value academic freedom, and that they appreciate the critical role of unfettered research and publication in advancing technology."" other companies have reacted otherwise, using the dmca to threaten researchers. the recording industry association of america last year warned princeton professor edward felten after his research team exposed weaknesses in digital music security technologies. last month, hewlett packard (hp) threatened research collective snosoft over exposing a security vulnerability in hp's tru64 unix operating system. soon after, hp clarified that it would not use the dmca to stifle research or impede the flow of information that would improve computer security. huang said that while he is glad he can openly present his paper, ""the dmca clearly had a chilling effect on my work. i was afraid to submit my research for peer review until after the eff's efforts to clear potential legal restraints."" ""researchers should be analyzing security, not worrying about getting sued,"" said eff senior staff attorney lee tien. links for this release for huang's paper ftppublications.ai.mit.eduaipublications2002aim2002008.pdf for the ches program eff ""unintended consequences three years under the dmca"" report riaa sues professor edward felten over sdmi an article about hewlettpackard's threatening snosoft  end    eff thanks defcon eff thanks the dark tangent and other organizers of the def con x convention for their generous donation of exhibition space at def con ( def con is an ""underground"" computer security conference held each summer in las vegas. links defcon website  end    eff booth at linuxworld come visit eff at booth 488 at linuxworld next week. we'll be passing out information, good cheer, and a slew of new stickers. when august 13  15 10a  5p where booth 5 moscone center 747 howard street san francisco, ca 94103 links linuxworld conference website floor map and eff booth .cvn?b97 exbid50  end   deep links deep links is a new department in the effector featuring noteworthy newsitems, victories and threats from around the internet.  baen books expands fairusefriendly ebook program baen books will bind a cdrom into the october 2002 hardcover edition of war of honor, the latest volume in david weber's epic honor harrington spaceopera. the cd will contain at least 22 complete novels, all in open formats like html and rtf, with the fairusefriendly admonishment ""this disk and its contents may be copied and shared but not sold."" included on the disk are the entire honor harrington series to date, as well as other titles from the baen line, including keith laumer's retief! and larry niven and jerry pournelle's fallen angels. baen has been a bannercarrier for fairuse in electronic publishing, shipping text and html files that can be played on a multitude of devices. other publishers have chosen to publish their material in copycontrolled formats that make it impossible to legally loan or resell the titles you purchase, are locked to a specific device, can't play on every operating system, and occasionally lock out assistive technology like the screenreaders employed by the blind. dmitry skylarov, a russian scientist, was arrested in july 2001, for demonstrating how endusers could defeat the copyprevention employed by adobe's ebook technology. adobe asked the fbi to arrest skylarov for violating the digital millennium copyright act (dmca), which makes it a crime to describe techniques for circumventing copyprevention technology. though skylarov was later released, his employer, elcomsoft, is still facing charges in the usa, and the russian government has issued an advisory warning russian scientists to steer clear of american technical conferences until the dmca is repealed. here is baen's statement on the cd release you are about to start playing with a cdrom that has fairly extraordinary content. as of this writing it includes twentytwo unencrypted novels in several formats, the ten honor harrington novels, 3 honor harrington anthologies and 9 novels by friends of honor, and by the time of distribution it may well contain more.

can install, so that remote server logins will be possible. my one complaint is the base station's use of a serial connector instead of usb, but i suppose they were cutting costs. i'm also scoping out

a feel similar to chm, the tr format is quite easy to read, as it places section titles in a pane separate from content, allowing you, the reader, to navigate through our tips (or anything else) with much greater ease than the linear format the other versions present. the windows version of the software is truly designed with ease of use in mind. creating ebooks for tomeraider is a simple matter of combining a modified set of html tags with the designation for page breaks. the only trick for yankees like me is remembering that center is tagged centre in the software. gnomefeature the herd of star wars nerds triumph the dog is lowtech, he's not cute like the pets.com sock puppet, but he manages to maintain a twisted appeal to fans of lowbrow comedy. in this segment, triumph makes a mockery of geeks standing in line for episode ii. whether you've been one of those geeks yourself, or you've never understood why anyone would dress up and wait in line for a movie, you'll still find this film amusing. 10 minutes was more than necessary to get the point across, yet triumph delivers enough oneliners throughout to keep you watching all the way to the end. gnomeskin kids world for

least according to her biography), her interpretation of american jazz standards and show tunes is more remarkable than most native english speaking vocalists. no world tour is currently scheduled, so

tilt (9) special dvd features worth a lookthornton and coen brothers commentary much more film noir, than a movie trying to imitate film noir, the man who wasn't there captures the inevitable hopelessness of the genre. ed crane (billy bob thornton) is the archetype everyman. a barber by trade, crane represents the individual in society. he hears everything, but truly knows nothing. everything he hears is modified ever so slightly by the retelling. he gets neither the whole story nor the true motivations. left to guess at the motivations and desires of those around him, crane develops an indifference to it all. when a snake oil sales man slithers into town, crane takes this opportunity to cheat the cheaters and punish the punishers. as indifferent as crane appears, he is no match for the amorality of fate. as much as fate is indifferent in its wrath, however, so is it artistic in its execution. that is what makes our lives so entertaining. fate doles ultimate justice, but never as expected. the man who wasn't there is truly a kafkaesque tale of an individual's year to turn against the tide of inevitability. atypical of cuter, more recent coen brothers fare, this film is reminiscent of their earlier noir works like blood simple and miller's crossing. frances mcdormand does an outstanding job making as crane's selfish wife and james gandolfini exudes boorishness as doris' boss. the real outstanding performances, however, rest with the supporting cast. tony shalhoub, as pompus attorney freddy riedenschneider and jon polito as the snake oil salesman impress and entertain as cruel, but offbeat parodies of their characters. the black and white cinematography by roger deakins also impresses and precisely underscores the bleakness of crane's life and the monochromatic nature of fate. region 1 encoding (us and canada only) format bw, widescreen anamorphic, closed captioned sound dolby digital 5.1, dolby digital 2.0 surround spanish, dolby digital

i've finally done it! lockrgnome's top 50 mac os x tips is in publication and available for purchase at gnometomes.com. less than half the tips have appeared in the apple core newsletter already, so purchasing them means getting mostly brand new content. this represents the first thing i've written that people might actually pay to read, so if we sell one copy, i'll be ecstatic. and hopefully, any of you who check out the tips will find them useful. i know that figuring out how to do each of the 50 things on the list has improved my personal os x experience. although this newsletter started out with chris, randy, and i writing sections of the newsletter, time constraints have limited the contributions of the other two guys. this does not mean either of them is truly less involved, it just means i'm doing more writing. both chris and randy regularly send me links to cool mac stuff they find, much of which will ultimately end up in upcoming issues. since the writing will be primarily mine, i've opted to eliminate the ""review by"" links at the bottom of each article. unless otherwise noted, you can safely assume i wrote it. if you need to send me an email, the email the editors link in the sidebar will reach me, as well as putting your message in front of chris and randy. i've been doing some exploring of applescript over the past several months and believe i'm finally confidant enough in writing scripts that i'm going to add a section on scripting to the newsletter. i'm curious to know what your level of experience with scripting is, because i can either start with some really basic stuff, or skip the basics and dive into meatier scripting topics. either way, i'm open to some applescript suggestions . see you in august , jake ludington for mac outlook users os x tips  gnomedownloads sherlock plugins v2.2 600k mac os 9osx free while doing some research for my top 50 tips, i discovered that turning off some of sherlock's extras, like multilanguage indexing, in the preferences will speed things up considerably, particularly for local machine searches. this renewed my interest in finding ways to addon search capabilities to the bundled sleuth, resulting in my discovery of searchstandard.com. this bundled collection of search plugins makes it possible to look for almost anything using sherlock. their web site won't wow you, but searchstandard's free plugins most certainly make finding things online, including searches on your favorite mac sites, that much easier. gnomenetwork xnet v1.0.6 216k osx $48 dealing with servers that offer mission critical services, like intranet access, email, or web serving, means dealing with those services failing from time to time. don't be left in the dark when one of your services go down, let xnet keep you informed. the unregistered version of the product lets you verify ping, smtp, and ftp service availability, with many more service verifications included in the pro version. xnet runs on your local machine, verifying remote service availability and sending you a message when those services go down. the interface allows for userdefined services, with alert features for both an email account (mine alerts are going to my cell phone) and locally via a sound from your machine. gnometerminal for os x installs with multiple users, there may come a time when you need to change ownership of a particular file. this is particularly useful in situations where one user created a file, but an entirely different user is the only one who will ever make future decisions relating to that file, like whether to keep it or throw it in the trash. chown is the terminal command designed to handle this. from the command line type sudo chown username filename you'll of course want to substitute the username of the new owner for username. the name of the file receiving a change of ownership will replace filename. 50 linux tips from the mind behind the penguin shell come two more ebooks in the gnometome series. whether you are a linux newbie or command line guru, you'll want these tips as part of your information arsenal. get your copy of tony's top 50 penguintweaks or top 50 penguincore tips today!

back in the days of college email accounts, every time i changed isps i had to send a mass email to my contacts and hope they saved my new address, otherwise i could miss out on getting their correspondence. the great thing about reroute's service is that i don't have to worry about lost emails after changing isps. sign up for the service, and they will take any email sent to your old account and forward it to your new email address. after that, reroute emails the sender to notify them of your new address. if you are with aol, msn, or any of their featured partners, then the first month is free. if not, then reroute charges a very nominal fee of ten bucks for the one month and twentyfive bucks for 3 months. have someone else handle all my changing email address need! s? sounds like money well spent! recommend it! gnometip just because it is summer and bright out doesn't mean that you should stop using your flash on your digital camera. bright sunlight creates harsh shadows that may cause you to lose detail. don't you hate those pictures where you can only see half of someone's face because the other half is black from a shadow? well, the cure is in front of you... use your flash during the daytime to throw a little light into those shadows. some cameras allow you to adjust how much flash is used, also known as flash exposure compensation. if you can adjust the output of your flash, then try it at the lowest setting first. remember, you don't want to completely get rid of the shadows because they add depth to your photo. keep increasing your flash output until you get your desired results. also, as an extra tip, don't forget that you can conserve battery life on your digital camera by turning on the autofocus option and turning off the lcd display. recommend it! your subscribed email address is  to unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription management page. for further information, please refer to the gnomecredits in the sidebar. look over here download our tip files latest windows daily latest digital media latest tech specialist latest penguin shell latest apple core latest web weekly latest bits  bytes find the lowest price suggest a feature advertise with us the gnomestore hightech job search chat with gnomies watch the webcams computer power user read past issues download xsetup about lockergnome our privacy policy view more options our xml  rss feed syndicate our tips link to lockergnome get chris's book tell a friend about us! general feedback email the editor the editor's blog search gnomespecials manage your workgroup form pilot say the time 5.0 boomer  stream now create webcd catalog easy web editor kleptomania tagrename pretty good solitaire visualize color combos firststop websearch ecobuilder book collector get listed here question which group is 250,000 strong and always looking for stuff to make their personal and professional lives run smoother?

i've received some of these as well, and i know it's become a widespread problem with other ezine publishers, creating a lot of ill will all around. is there some configuration that we could change to keep these from going out except to legitimate subscribers? lyris unfortunately, there isn't much we can do about this since it isn't actually listmanager doing the sending. the real problem is that people sometimes will add the ""join"" address to their address book and that is what causes the problems. the best we can do is advise people not to have their address books set to automatically add any email address that they send a message to even once. the main culprit here seems to be outlook express. what's coming next week another batch of neat net tricks in the premium issue, including  a great collection of information and free downloads to make your system more secure.  free software to measure and display your realtime internet speed.  can you handle still another popup stopper  that's interference free  and at no cost?

if you can't afford or wait out a 30% drop in the value of your savings, keep it out of the market. of course, we're not just going to leave you hanging. to figure out the best place to keep your shortterm savings, visit our nifty savings center.  community tips do (at least) one thing differently folks on the living below your means discussion board have been sharing at least one thing they are going to do differently in 2002 to save money. i am going to make sure i carry my coupon envelope in my purse so i don't find myself at the grocery store buying a bunch of stuff on which i could save a bunch of money if i hadn't left my coupons at home. make sure i get reimbursed for every dime my company owes me. i have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff, like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. ten miles is $3.10 and if i do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30 bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for. i'm going to make at least one crockpot meal a week so i don't get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. fridays would be a great time to do this. either cut down on the longdistance phone calls, or else find a cheaper longdistance plan. document everything that i give to charity, including the clothes and books, so that i can deduct it from my taxes. keep turning down the thermostat at night and when i leave the house. run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat). have any tips of your own?

""simple"" means investing in companies that we all  with a little effort  can understand. companies where we know what businesses they're really in. companies where the financial statements actually mean something. and companies easily recognizable as the ""best of breed."" in the free report you received, ""the one stock that keeps wall street buzzing,"" you read about one of david  tom's very favorite investments starbucks. before this company came along, most folks just took coffee for granted. and certainly, no one proposed any farreaching business model built around it. yet these innovators took a lowmargin commodity and built a near $3 billion company with more than 5000 retail outfits all around the world. starbucks has been able to open new outlets based on money it has earned from existing ones. that is an astounding testament to its economic power. at the motley fool stock advisor we'll help you find and truly understand the great investments, the companies with solid balance sheets and real growth prospects. right now we're following companies such as america's most prestigious jeweler  its brand name has no rival. with net margins of 59% on sales of $1.6 billion, this company is a great pick for solid returns with low risk. this software company commands more than 25% of the video game market. its shares have returned 6,000% since its public debut in 1989. an investment of $5,000 in 1989 is now worth over $300,000. the video game market is expected to double by 2005 with this company enjoying the lion's share of the growth. this premier credit rating company has lockedin demand for its reports on the creditworthiness of borrowers holding $30 trillion of the world's debt. it has a 20year record of consistent sales and income growth and is poised for another stellar year. you can try the ""motley fool stock advisor"" for six full months 100% riskfree. if we don't prove its worth to you, it doesn't cost you a dime. as a charter subscriber, you get the ""motley fool stock advisor"" delivered to your home each month a monthly, betweenissue, email fool flash to help you take full advantage of breaking news full use of the motley fool stock advisor subscriberonly web site, featuring current  back newsletter issues...full updates on all selected stocks...q  a...and more plus introductory special reports exclusively for new subscribers. to join riskfree, as a charter subscriber to ""david  tom gardner's motley fool stock advisor,"" simply click here now sincerely yours, mike bell, publisher ""david  tom gardner's motley fool stock advisor"" p.s. do you like big profits? in 1994, investment pros sniffed at america online's highflying stock and screamed, ""overvalued."" but the gardners saw three things they overlooked 1) aol was building the premier stop in cyberspace 2) they had a great retention strategy and 3) millions of members paying $$$ every month. so tom and david bought it. and today they're sitting on whopping 4,120% gains. so you see, while they do structure their investing strategy to avoid big blunders...they do make a lot of money, too. to try the ""motley fool stock advisor"" riskfree, click here now  how to unsubscribe we hope this email message is of value to you. if however, you do not wish to receive any of our future messages, please unsubscribe by going to the following web address note if you unsubscribe by replying to this message please use unsubscribe or remove in the subject line. mon jul 29 170426 2002",[],7165,0,0,hard_ham_testing

""this is a tremendous day for european internet users,"" said eurocauce chairman george mills. ""we are extremely pleased that the european parliament has listened to the citizens of its member countries and added the right to be left alone by spammers to its efforts to protect the privacy of europeans."" while six european union member countries had already formalized ""optin"" in their national laws and regulations, yesterday's vote should turn all of europe into a spamfree zone by the end of 2003. ""unfortunately, the rest of the world's internetusing countries, including the united states, now lag behind europe in their protection of internet users,"" said cauce chairman scott hazen mueller. ""this is a tremendous first step, but the rest of the world now needs to follow europe's lead and unite behind protection of internet users and network owners from abusive and costly unsolicited email advertising."" ""this decision is the direct result of internet users throughout the european union standing up for their rights, and members of the european parliament listening to their constituents,"" said mills.

they are, after all, metaphorical. they can be filled with whatever symbolism you choose. written well, we all come to some similar understanding of their meaning. but, i'll depart today, contrary to my normal practice, to take a few minutes explaining a recent metaphor. i'm a linux guy through and through. as a user, i see myself as right about at the average on the curve. for love of the language and open source attitude, though, you'd be hardpressed to find anyone with quite the same level of enthusiasm. put simply, there's very little about the linux and broader open source worlds that i don't like or believe in. take, for example, the practice of recursive acronyms. gnu (""gnu's not unix""), hurd (""herd of unixreplacing daemons""), wine (""wine is not an emulator""), even php (""php hypertext processor"")  all carry on the tradition of recursion in the unixlinux world. goofy as it sounds, i love this stuff. so it is that i set out to create a recursive metaphor last week. it could only have happened on or about the 4th of july. in fact, it happened in the edition of the 3rd. i wrote a piece about how we americans spend more time over the course of a year talking about what's wrong with our system than what's right. i wrote it knowing full well that many of the responses i'd get would be a) from readers outside the us and b) in sharp disagreement to my comments or those of citizens of other countries. you're following me, right? people would disagree with an article that said we spend much time disagreeing. this, of course, would prove my point in a somewhat metaphorical way  the perfect recursive metaphor. the point was to be made yet more perfectly by the eventual inclusion in penguin shell of the comments of someone from outside the us disagreeing with my take our argumentativeness as americans. ideally, they would be comments that disagreed with our collective american perception of being disagreeable. they would, of course, point out things about which citizens of other countries can disagree with americans on. by exercising the right to disagree, we'd subtly agree that we have that right. yet another level of recursion and a final layer of metaphor. the response to both my own and johan sauviller's comments was overwhelming. in the main, i believe both were appreciated. many commented on the balance of the two pieces. some readers were surprised, i think, to see a dissenting opinion published so quickly, if at all. overall, the ability to express honestly held opinions, to agree and to disagree on a global level closed the circle on the metaphor in a perfect way. things have, however, gotten a bit more ugly in the past few days. i'm not sure whether some were slow in getting to the july 3rd issue, or whether it's just been stewing since then. take, for instance, these comments by a reader who will remain mercifully nameless we get enough america bashing from our leftwing whacko extremist press and schools here in the usa that we don't wish to hear some (insert favorite adjective here) from belgium whining too! followed by ... please don't let tony singlehandedly tarnish the fine reputation of lockergnome. i'm sure there are other articulate linux experts out there who would be able to replace him. ... and, in a later note on the topic ... censorship is to be encouraged in a freemarket society whenever and wherever it doesn't come from the government. clearly, the metaphor just whizzed right over the heads of some. chris has been great about allowing all his authors plenty of room in the editorial piece at the beginning of each newsletter. this particular piece is no exception. he's shown a quiet confidence in the face of some very shrill comments. while we all generally stay focused on technical issues, chris has shown unwavering support for the notion that we geeks are, in the end, humans with opinions and thoughts to share. i think it's one of the things that makes the lockergnome newsletters stand out from the pack  the personal touch. so, despite the irrationality of some of this week's comments, i'll continue to occasionally throw in a personal aside with the technical stuff. just watch out. recursive metaphors are only funny until someone puts an eye out. tony steidlerdennison gnometweak lockergnome readers, save 50% on the computing encyclopedia! are you looking

linux? yesterday, i mentioned an interesting review of two products for linux by codeweavers  crossover office and crossover plugin. you've probably heard of both by now, as they've garnered quite a bit of publicity both in and out of the linux world. you'll recall that i promised to try to secure copies for review this week. with the help of a friendly sales rep at codeweavers, i was able to accomplish that task this morning. true to the second half of the promise, we'll spend the next few days looking at these two products and how they might impact your linux use. let's take them in chronological order, starting today with crossover plugin. a bit of background is in order. codeweavers is, in their own words, "" ... the leading corporate backer of the wine project . wine has been, for the past several years, an ongoing project to port windows applications to linux. it's a tough goal, but it's also one that's been undertaken by others in the past year or so. though the progress has been slow, the wine project has managed to stay at the front of this development realm. crossover plugin marks a change in the philosophy of the wine project. prior to its release, wine had taken a ""full system"" approach. running windows applications in wine required the installation of a sizeable daemon and no small amount of configuration work. crossover plugin has moved wine away from the systemwide approach to one that's much more modular. rather than executing at system startup, wine is called asneeded, with the virtual windows path to the called program. when the program is closed, so is wine. crossover plugin has focused on creating linux functionality with one related set of windows applications browser plugins. the results stand as a clear indication that the change in philosophy is a success. off the top, crossover plugin bundles quicktime 5, windows media player 6.2, shockwave 8.5, flash 6, and realplayer 8 into a linuxaccesible browser plugin package. throw in more esoteric apps like ipix, trillian, authorware web player 6 and efax messenger 2, and you've got virtually every need plugin need covered. but this package doesn't stop there. included in the crossover plugin package are viewers for word, excel and powerpoint, as well as several microsoftoriented fonts. honestly, i was stunned at the range of applications offered by the codeweavers developers. having had some experience with wine, i was a bit leery about the install process and about the ability to get all these great applications to work with my redhat setup. i've never been completely successful with wine, but i hoped for the best when i started the crossover plugin installation. i really did want these apps to work. the installation was quite easy. by running the installcrossover.sh script from the command line, i was able to install the installers for both crossover plugin and crossover office, which we'll talk about tomorrow. i started the plugin installs with quicktime, a tool i've admittedly missed in linux. in the background, crossover plugin had already created a virtual c drive on my machine. i clicked on the quicktime install and immediately saw a familiar sight  the vise installer in its windows format. crossover plugin first checked for feedback from the windows binary, opened a virtual windows window, then stepped out while the vise installer took care of the rest. though the install failed four times, it appeared to be a server failure rather than a failure of the crossover program. i kept ""retry""ing and, with some persistence, managed to get a full quicktime 5 install downloaded from the apple servers. quite literally, the install looked and performed exactly as i've seem many times in windows. when the install was completed, crossover again checked for the windows binary, located the appropriate .dll files in the virtual c drive and dropped the plugins into the hometony.netscapeplugins and hometony.mozillaplugins directories. the process was so smooth that i had to check the plugin listings in these browsers  ""help"", ""about plugins."" sure enough, the crossover quicktime plugin was listed. quickly, i ran out to the apple site and opened the ""men in black ii"" movie trailer. quicktime performed flawlessly. i followed with the windows media player, shockwave, flash, ipix, and efax messenger installs. of those, the only ones that weren't selfcontained in the crossover install were ipix and efax. even at that, the installer pointed me to the windows download then found the .exe file when the download was done. within a halfhour, i had all installed and tested. then, just for grins, i installed realplayer 8 via crossover. this was despite the recommendation in the installer screen to use the linux version. it went as smoothly as the others with one caveat  the player played media files at a much faster speed than that in windows. fast enough to make me laugh, in fact, reminded of dave and alvin the chipmunk. ah well, six out of seven is pretty strong given my previous troubles with wine. i also installed a few fonts  arial, times new roman, trebuchet, and veranda. in every case, the install was quick and absolutely painless. wine has always held great promise. at times, it's been painful to watch the tedious pace of development, only because that promise was so alluring. with the backing of codeweavers and a fundamental change in the approach to development, wine has finally realized the goal of integrating windows applications seamlessly into the stable linux environment. the results are so strong that, if i didn't know better, i'd swear that a few of these plugins actually run better in linux than in their native windows. honestly, i didn't realize how much i missed them until i started using them in linux today. tomorrow holds a few surpirses, with a look at codeweavers' crossover office package. recommend it! send us a gnometweak gnomecore kernel configuration  part ix we're nine parts into the kernel configuration series, with quite a bit yet to go. if you haven't been following along, we're breaking out the configuration screens one at a time in an attempt to shed some light on the purpose and function of each. with that knowledge, you should be able to make a clear decision as to how to configure each section. today, it's the parallel port support section. this is pretty simple. if you need parallel port support  such as for a printer  select this option either as a driver built into the kernel or as a loadable module. most will use the pcstyle hardware option in conjuction with a windows printer. but that's not all the parallel port can be used for. as an example, the builds i did with the telescope company required parallel port support, as the telescope cameras were attached to this port. be aware  this kernel configuration option only makes a driver available for the parallel port. the computer's bios sets the mode for the port  ecp, epp, or auto. on the majority of modern computers, the auto mode is the default and will work just fine. however, if you have problems communicating with your printer following a kernel recompile, try changing the mode of your printer in the bios. tomorrow, it's plug and play configuration. recommend it! send us a gnomecore tip

here's how go into the network connections window. you can get there from the network applet in the control panel. right click the network interface directly connected to the internet and click properties. click on the advanced tab in the connection's properties dialog box. put a checkmark in the internet connection firewall checkbox. always make sure the internet connection firewall (icf) is enabled when you connect a computer directly to the internet. click the settings button, then click on the services tab in the advanced settings dialog box. now click the add button. this brings up the service settings dialog box. type in my ftp server in the description of service text box. in the name or ip address text box, type in the ip address of the computer on your private network that's running the ftp server. since you're using ics, it'll have an ip address like 192.168.0.x, where x is different for each machine on your network. you might want to manually assign the ip address the ftp server already has, so that it doesn't change in the future. you can find out what ip address your ftp server is using by opening a command prompt at the ftp server and typing in the command ipconfig. that will give you the ip address the ftp server is using. back to the service settings dialog box, select the tcp option button. for the external port and the internet port, put in the port number you assigned to the ftp server on your internal network. read this week's how to section to see how to change the listening port number. clic! k ok click ok, and then click ok one more time! you might need to disable and enable the adapter after making the change. you can do that by right clicking the alwayson interface. the procedure is very similar for dialup connections. however, there are problems with dialup connections (and many alwayson connections) because the ip address on the external interface of the ics computer changes over time. next week i'll share with you a cool way you can get around this problem by using something called a ""dynamic dns service"". i've used one for years, and it works great. make sure to tune in next week for the details. there you have it. is server publishing in your future? have any questions on the method i described above? if so, let me know! there are lots of ways you can publish services. tell me how you do it, and tricks you've learned along the way. if you're having problems with server publishing, let me know about those too! i'll be sure to include what i learn from you in upcoming newsletters. until next week, tom shinder, editor (email us with feedback ) sponsor is your pc spying on you? you are surfing the web. check out sites, download some music or software that might be cool. guess what? your pc might have picked up a cyber transmitted disease (ctd). these pests might now be monitoring what you are doing and report this back to their ""black hat"" owners and reveal your personal information. pestpatrol kills 'em all off. get your copy on the online shop for just 30 bucks with immediate online delivery. protect your pc and your confidential data!

a couple other problems were found in wmp that could cause some problems. to read more about the problem head on over to you'll also find the download locations for windows media player versions 6.4, 7.1 and 8.0 (xp) on that page. cumulative patches for excel and word for windows if you run microsoft word or excel, versions 2000 or 2002 (xp), then you need to head on over to the microsoft site to download some security fixes. these fixes handle security glitches that could get you in trouble if you don't take care of them! head on over to microsoft's site where you can find individual fixes for each program. you only need download the fix that applies to your computer upgrading  compatibility issues a computer may hang during a heavy load with an ericsson his modem if your computer has a ericsson his modem, you might experience a dreaded blue screen and see the message irqlnotlessorequal or drivercorruptedexpool. the problem is that you're downloading too much and your poor modem can't keep up! microsoft recognizes that this isn't a problem with the modem, but with the modem driver. to download a fix visit microsoft's site. after getting the fix, you can download as much as you like without worrying about blue screens! knowledge base search center  if it is not broke, do not break it! it wasn't so long ago when you could search the microsoft knowledge base for articles that came up in the last 3 days, 7 days, 14 days, 30 days, 90 days and 6 months. it was great! but microsoft decided to ""fix"" the knowledge base search page, and now it really sucks! it's hard to find things that used to come up easily, the site is often down, and searching based on age of articles just doesn't work anymore. try this go to and on the left side of the page select windows xp in the top drop down list box. don't put anything in the for solutions containing...(optional) text box. leave the any of the words entered option selected in the using drop down list box. for maximum age select 3 days. for results limit select 150 articles. click search now. whoa! nothing. ok, it's reasonable to see no articles related to windows xp in the last 3 days. try again, this time using 7 days. whaat? still no articles. ok, it was a holiday week in the usa last week. let's try 14 days. nothing again! that seems sort of strange, doesn't it? let's give it another try with 30 days. still no articles! what's going on here? keep trying for 6 months and one year. you still won't find anything. it's pretty sad, because this used to work. winxp configuring  troubleshooting a description of the repair option on a local area network or highspeed internet connection here's the answer to a question i've had for a long time. what the heck does that ""repair"" option for a network connection actually do? it's not in the help file, but it's on the microsoft web site. here's what it does sends an ipconfig renew flushes the arp cache with a arp d reloads the netbios name cache with a nbtstat r updates its wins server with an nbtstat rr clear out the dns client cache with an ipconfig flushdns reregisters the client with a ddns server with a ipconfig registerdns check out the original article over at keyboard and mouse do not work when you start windows have you been hit with this one? you're working in windows xp and shut down for the day. the next morning you start up your windows xp computer and the mouse pointer is stuck! the only way to get it going again is to restart the computer, and for some reason the pointer starts moving again. what's up with that? i still haven't figured that one out, but microsoft has a kb article that claims it's from a corrupt registry. i doubt that's the case in my situation because the problem is intermittent. but if you find that your mouse is always stuck, you might want to check out how to deploy windows xp images from windows 2000 ris servers are you planning to roll out lots of windows xp computers on your network in the near future? if so, you're probably looking for a good way to automate the process. you can use the windows 2000 remote installation services (ris) if you're running windows 2000 servers on your network. for the basic procedure and some tips, tricks, and gotcha's, check out fave links this week's links we like. tips, hints and fun stuff be afraid, be very afraid  the future of big brother in computing get revenge on your computer!

the fourth edition of the iso17799 newsletter, designed to keep you abreast of news and developments with respect to iso17799 and information security. the information contained in this newsletter is absolutely free to our subscribers and provides guidance on various practical issues, plus commentary on recent information security incidents. guidance and information included in this issue 1) the iso17799 toolkit uncovered 2) social engineering  are you susceptible? 3) iso17799 a world wide phenomena 4) stranger danger 5) iso17700 more frequently asked questions 6) credit card transactions  minimize the risks 7) bsi certifications  congratulations 8) iso17799 section 11  bcp review 9) it couldn't happen here.... could it? 10) subscription information the iso17799 toolkit uncovered  the iso17799 standard can be acquired either stand alone or as part of an introductory pack appropriately called 'the iso17799 toolkit'. but why was it packaged thus, and what is included in the pack? the purpose of the toolkit is to help organizations get off to a flying start with respect to iso17799... not only to understand the standard itself but to begin to address many of the standard's requirements more quickly. the contents can be broken down into two groups those that help the organization to understand where iso17799 fits and what is involved in embracing it, and those that help an organization to take the first critical steps to compliance. in the former group are the 'roadmap to certification' (which broadly describes the process of gaining certification), the 'xl management presentation' (which explains the history, background and current status of the standard) and of course the iso17799 standard itself (both parts). in the latter group are some key items to aid compliance. these include a comprehensive set of iso17799 compliant security policies to address section 3 (security policy) and business continuity audit checklists to help address section 11 (business continuity management). it doesn't end there, however. for the audit section there is a detailed set of audit questionnaires to address various issues and platforms. for newcomers to information security there is even a substantial glossary of terms. clearly, creating such a toolkit was a significant undertaking. however, in terms of helping organizations exploring the initial stages of iso17799, it can be invaluable. more information on the iso17799 toolkit and how to purchase can be found at the standard itself can alternatively be procured from social engineering  are you susceptible?  the term 'social engineering' can conjure up a variety of ideas, usually based around the concept of genetic tampering. however, when applied to it security, it has its own implications and its own vocabulary. following interviews with known computer criminals, a list of approaches has been produced. these are designed to gather information without the target even realizing that they have parted with it. the attempts are often made on an opportune bases, with common locations for this sort of activity being planes, trains and pubs. the telephone is probably the major source of premeditated acts. the following are some of the major techniques employed baiting this essentially involves asking a variety of questions, including some leading questions designed to 'catch' the right answers. often, items of conversation are introduced based upon replies received. the fiction is legitimized with small amounts of fact in the right places. pulling rank this amounts ot the perpetrator assuming a more senior position in the company than the victim and is usually enacted on the telephone. it does not necessitate direct impersonation... only the position needs to be assumed. exhausting this involves asking a constant stream of similar questions to wear down the target. surf boarding basically this is looking over someone's shoulder at something confidential. this could be directly, through a window, through a doorway, etc. surveys the information given freely in surveys can often be extremely useful to a criminal. the surveys can initially be for entirely legitimate purposes, or can be completely bogus from the start. in either case sensitive information can often be obtained and unwittingly disclosed. there are of course many other techniques. however, disclosure can be prevented via the use of a series of common sense rules and policies. before releasing any information it is essential to at least establish a) the sensitivity of the information b) your authority to exchange or release the information c) the real identity of the third party (proper authentication) d) the purpose of the exchange the act of exchange should also be recorded for audit purposes. iso17799  a world wide phenomina  disney would have said ""it's a small world after all"", but the global take on of iso17799 proves that organizations the planet over are embracing it with enthusiasm. to illustrate the global nature of the standard, we recently created a table from the last 500 purchases of the standard from the iso17799 electronic shop ( the figures below do come with a serious health warning though  the electronic shop is a credit card purchase system. some cultures are not as comfortable or familiar as others with credit card purchase and will therefore have their purchase position significantly understated. an example is india, which acquires substantial numbers of the standard, only two of which show in the last 500 from the download location. that aside, the table makes interesting reading argentina 1 australia 6 austria 5 barbados 2 belgium 5 bermuda 1 bosnia and herzegovina 1 brasil 2 brazil 4 canada 52 cayman islands 1 chile 3

sensitive because you deal with them every day... but now look again. if you were alone and not a member of staff, how would you view them? what would you find if you looked around? picture yourself as a visitor passing through. what can you hear in terms of conversation? what can you see? the chances are that you can hear and see quite a lot that you would not want to be openly disclosed to the outside world. if this is the case, the security of your information is at risk potentially from every visitor, stranger, subcontractor, etc. this article is not written with the intention of discrediting visitors, but nonetheless, it is important to be fully aware of what can happen if due caution is not exercised. the following guidelines may help in ensuring that the risks are minimized  your receptionvisitor area should issue distinctive badges and ensure that visitors wear them  consider using different colored badges for each day of the week.  challenge those who are not displaying any identity badges  if your location issues identity badges  make sure you wear yours  do not be afraid to ask someone who they are visiting and what they are doing  do not be lazy... escort visitors from reception (if applicable)... don't let them make their way to you  do not hold doors open for people not displaying their id  do not leave visitors alone iso17799  more frequently asked questions  1) how many controls are there in the standard? part 1 is organized into 10 sections. there are 127 main controls and over 500 detailed controls in total. 2) what is part 2? part 2 basically explains how to apply the standard itself, and how to build and operate an information security management system. 3) how old is it? the standard stems from an original publication in 1993, from the dti in the uk. it became bs7799 in 1995 and of course iso17799 in 2000. 4) what is accreditation? an accreditation body can authorize others to ""certify"" third parties under the standard (p2). a number of accreditation bodies exist in different countries. 5) is certification for life? no. it is normally for three year periods. 6) iso17799 is used throughout the world, but was it internationally created? yes indeed. the latest versions included input from representatives from many nations, including australia, brazil, germany, norway, uk and usa, amongst others. 7) is it linked to a specific national legal system? no. it is generic in terms of legislation. credit card transactions minimize the risks  the use of credit and debit cards to purchase goods and services has become an everyday convenience that we take for granted, but there are associated information security risks which we should pause to consider, especially when making payments over the internet. web sites are becoming an increasingly popular means of purchasing goods and services, but they have also become popular targets for cyber criminals, who often use stolen credit card numbers to purchase goods, which can then be easily exchanged for cash. there are also relatively simple technologies now readily available which could be used by hackers to surreptitiously steal vast amounts of money, a few pounds at a time, from millions of people. a survey by the it research company gartner ( predicted that internet crime involving the ""mass victimization"" of consumers could take place by the end of this year. we recommend the following best practice guidelines to minimize the risks involved in credit card transactions  ensure that credit cards used to purchase goods or services on the internet have a low credit limit, or if debit cards are used, that they have limited funds and are only topped up to cover specific internet purchases.  all expenses incurred through internet transactions should be carefully audited on a regular basis for any anomalies.  only enter credit card details on a web site if you are confident as to its authenticity and that the connection is secure  the prefix (as opposed to the usual in the web site address indicates a secure connection.  if the security of a web site is in doubt, any confidential information posted to it may be exposed to malicious intent. be extremely cautious when posting confidential details on any site where the internet service provider hosting the site is not verified. note that we have prechecked all sites referenced in this newsletter for security!  if ordering by telephone using a credit card, ensure that you are talking to the correct person. if you are unsure whether the organization you are dealing with will handle your details sensitively, pay by some other means.  lost or stolen credit card details may be used for internet transactions. inform the card issuer and relevant person within your organization immediately if a company credit card is lost or stolen. bsi  certifications  congratulations to all the following who have been certified by bsi with respect to bs7799 part2 for at least

section 11 bcp review  business continuity planning is covered by section 11 of the standard, a core requirement of which is the creation and maintenance of a business continuity plan. creating such a plan from scratch is a difficult undertaking of course. this is one reason why software products were produced. unfortunately these often become problematic in themselves... difficult to learn, expensive, etc. recent times have therefore seen a move to simplification, with organizations keen to avoid adding complexity to an already complex task. at the vanguard of this change was a product developed entirely in msword the bcp generator. this was designed from top down to simplify business continuity planning. it comprises two components a plan template and an interactive guide (the latter using word macros to jump to and fro into the correct part of the template). it's impact upon the business continuity scene has been substantial, with organizations from the very largest to the smallest embracing the tool and its concepts. it is in active use in over 40 countries. with this change of emphasis in the business continuity planning market, there is now no excuse for not creating a full recovery plan. the old lines of ""too expensive"" and ""too difficult"" are now less hollow than they ever were. although section 11 is very clear with respect to the need of a comprehensive plan, it is surely also a matter of due diligence to have one, and equally, irresponsibility not to have one. for information on the bcp generator see for information on business continuity generally, see it couldn't happen here....could it?  every issue of the iso17799 newsletter features at least one true story of an information security breach and its consequences. again, in this issue, we focus upon 'low tech' but high impact incidents 1) on 25th october a contract programmer who had once worked for a large us based bank walked into the 'inner sanctum' of the main building (the security guards remembered him as someone permitted to do so). in the dealing room he claimed to be conducting a quality audit and interrogated a junior employee and watched a program run  noting down security codes as they were entered. he then left and hung around outside until just after normal trading time. he then rang the bank from a public phone box and initiated an electronic funds transfer using the codes... $10.2m to a swiss account. the plan nearly failed when he found that he had noted one of the codes incorrectly, but he rang the bank department back and incredibly managed to trick a different employee into revealing the correct digit. he flew to switzerland and later returned with the money. he was caught simply because he couldn't resist boasting about his great feat. when the police contacted the bank they were still totally unaware of their loss! 2) remote, or dialin access can be a real achilles heel if not properly controlled. in a recent case a young hacker gained access to a major company's system by using the default password of a system engineer (which had never been changed!). this gave him considerable scope and powers of access. to cover for himself, however, he semidisabled the machine log, changed a number of user passwords, created several fictitious privileged users and tampered with the dial back system. getting more ambitious he established a communication link with another computer and ended up making it crash. all this took place over a couple of evenings. to recover from the havoc the installation had to close down its prime computer and restore from the previous weeks backup, at considerable cost. 3) over a period of nine months, the number of computer malfunctions within a large company had risen from an average of two per year to critical levels. the impact was such that the business fell behind with its invoicing systems and had to buy processing and backup from third parties. as it could not deliver some of its services reliably, it started to lose the confidence of its customers. the situation began to spiral. eventually, the company suspected foul play may be involved and called the police. secret surveillance equipment was installed to monitor staff. one was filmed lightly scratching circuit boards in disk units and also attaching paper clips to them. both these actions led to a short circuit. when confronted, he confessed everything. his motive was to earn overtime, which was required to process the overlap work which was delayed by the malfunction. he netted 689 ukp over the 9 months. the company lost at least 500,000 ukp. contributions have you got something to say on the topic of iso17799... a fresh insight or some information which might benefit others? if so, please feel free to

a. there are three main credit bureaus in the united states, and they've agreed that if someone contacts one of them and asks to be removed from junk mail (er, ""direct mail"") lists and telemarketing phone lists, they'll all honor the request. full answer  your money resolutions you can keep let's face it, new year's resolutions are mostly nightmares that hang over our heads like that dark cloud that follows eeyore everywhere he goes. we mostly fail to keep our resolutions because they are too vague and imply guiltinducing judgment. 1. live every moment. 2. be a good person. 3. lose a lot of weight. no pressure. right? wrong. don't despair. we've put together a quick, proactive todo list that is actually doable. this year's resolution save big bucks now and live comfortably in the future. now that's a resolution you can get behind. let's get started! 1. dial away your debt it's true. you can lower your credit card interest rates with one phone call. 2. get more from your savings don't stash your shortterm cash savings under your mattress. earn higher yields on cds, money markets, and more. 3. invest for less make sure your broker isn't charging you too much. compare rates and hire a new one in only 60 seconds. 4. retire early thanks to recent tax law changes, you can start pitching in more to your retirement accounts. 5. refinance and save when interest rates drop, some homeowners have the opportunity to save big money. if this list seems too daunting, and you don't want to go it alone, you can get some unbiased, professional advice about your finances with tmf money advisor. in fact, we're so excited about this service, we are offering a free onemonth trial subscription. for more information, go here. for more moneysaving tips to aid your journey to financial independence, visit our personal finance area.  spotlight should all my savings be in the market? um, no. we are big supporters of the idea that all of your longterm money should be in the stock market. but over the short term, the market is too volatile. buying stocks for shortterm gain is really speculating, not investing. would you have wanted to have your emergency fund, or your house down payment, or your kid's tuition in the nasdaq at its height on march 10, 2000? if you can't afford or wait out a 30% drop in the value of your savings, keep it out of the market. of course, we're not just going to leave you hanging. to figure out the best place to keep your shortterm savings, visit our nifty savings center.  community tips do (at least) one thing differently folks on the living below your means discussion board have been sharing at least one thing they are going to do differently in 2002 to save money. i am going to make sure i carry my coupon envelope in my purse so i don't find myself at the grocery store buying a bunch of stuff on which i could save a bunch of money if i hadn't left my coupons at home. make sure i get reimbursed for every dime my company owes me. i have a bad habit of not filing expense reports for little stuff, like 10 miles of mileage to go to a mediation. ten miles is $3.10 and if i do that 10 times a year, that's more than 30 bucks, and definitely worth filing an expense report for. i'm going to make at least one crockpot meal a week so i don't get tempted to go out and buy something to eat. fridays would be a great time to do this. either cut down on the longdistance phone calls, or else find a cheaper longdistance plan. document everything that i give to charity, including the clothes and books, so that i can deduct it from my taxes. keep turning down the thermostat at night and when i leave the house. run my humidifier (moist air is cheaper to heat). have any tips of your own?

as it turns out, it was another case of ""always check the small stuff"". oh, i had all of the cables plugged back in to the server properly, i checked all of that, but it didn't dawn on me until about a half dozen boot attempts later that i should probably turn an eye toward the other end of the cables. that server is connected to an 8port compaq kvm switch and with all of the yanking, plucking and shuffling, the keyboard cable had been eeked out of the switch just a tad. why the server didn't display a keyboard warning message like every other computer on the planet, i can only attribute to the bios developers. server satchel, running red hat linux 7.2 is now operating as it was previously. the penguin is happy. the server case is even black. how appropriate... see you in august , randy nieland gnomenetwork windows xp security checklist finely crafted by bernie klinder with all of the security features crammed into windows xp, where does one start?

those of us that have had to manage budgets are used to dealing with math in terms of hardware, software, maintenance and personnel costs. it's not really that difficult. it's certainly not hard to see that dropping a free version of linux on a server with less hardware requirements just to do some file sharing, printing and maybe an intranet page or three is far cheaper than using windows. at very long last, microsoft has admitted as much. of course, they're quick to point out that they have much more to offer than linux, which may indeed be true. but at the end of the day, when you compare donuts to donuts and like functions against one another, linux is cheaper. for a shop of windowstrained staff, dealing with linux will certainly be a challenge, requiring additional training, suffer the odd blunder here and there, and be less forgiving when it comes to detailed configuration. on the same token, make a linux whiz use windows and see how quickly you'll be searching for a replacement. cheap is in the budget of the beholder. recommend it! your subscribed email address is  to unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription management page. for further information, please refer to the gnomecredits in the sidebar. look over here download tip ebooks latest windows daily latest digital media latest tech specialist latest penguin shell latest apple core latest web weekly latest bits  bytes latest audio show low price search our tech conference microsoft office tips pc productivity tips cool internet tips windows 2000 tips windows xp tips tell a friend about us! suggest a feature advertise with us hightech job search chat with gnomies watch the webcams computer power user read past issues download xsetup about lockergnome our privacy policy view more options our xml  rss feed syndicate our tips link to lockergnome get chris's book email a suggestion your rant  rave general feedback the editor's blog email the editor sound systems yamaha rxv1200 sony davc900 harman kardon avr520 denon avr5803 pioneer vsxd811s pioneer elite vsx49tx sony htddw840 yamaha htr5560 bose ls122bk sony davc450 gnomespecials manage your workgroup form pilot say the time 5.0 boomer  stream now create webcd catalog easy web editor kleptomania tagrename pretty good solitaire visualize color combos firststop websearch ecobuilder book collector get listed here question which group is 250,000 strong and always looking for stuff to make their personal and professional lives run smoother?

at first glance, it looks like apple is only paying lipservice to true windows compatibility. i've seen no mention of any additional functionality, besides song management via one media playing utility. mediafour's xplay remains a better option, in my opinion. in addition to allowing you to use an ipod with almost any media player made for windows, it assists with contact management, via outlook vcards, in addition to making the ipod an additional drive on your pc. at a mere $10 more than musicmatch jukebox plus, xplay blows the doors off apple's officially endorsed player. lori and i made the five and a half hour drive to st. louis for this year's sic without a hitch. i just missed a facetoface introduction to john lal, of winferno.com , although i'm sure we'll meet tomorrow. john's the guy behind the free copy of researchdesk for all gnomedex attendees. shortly after arrival, i enjoyed dinner with the esellerate gang, with a discussion about gnometomes and what the future holds. every time i travel, i'm reminded just how slow dialup really is. fortunately, my crosspaths.net connection allows me to send mail via my lockergnome account, unlike most of the national dialup services. crosspaths is technically an iowa isp, although the have points of presence in almost every major city in the country. if you're a dialup user, you may want to take a look at their offerings, regardless of where you live. lori has used their dsl service for two years now, and they've been nothing short of outstanding in dealing with customer service queries. jake ludington gnomeproducer png files do not show transparency in internet explorer (q294714) this originally appeared in last weeks webmaster weekly, but due to its graphical nature, its worth inclusion here as well ""if you browse to a web page that contains an image that has a transparent background in portable network graphics (png) format, the image background may appear to be gray rather than transparent."" fortunately, microsoft explains a solution for this problem. personally, i haven't encountered this png display error, but for those of you simplementing pngs on your sites, you'll want to review the solution. gnomefeature glitschka.com flash animations, downloadable icons, artistic doodles, and details about the artist himself are available from this site. you're guaranteed to find something entertaining here, and if you need a logo designed, von robert glitschka might even take you on as a client. the portfolio is extensive, including stock images and even some icons by the artist's seven year old daughter. a must read is the anatomy of an illustration section, which lays down artistic opinion, straight from glitschka's mouth on how to make a funny creation. the entertainment is accessible accross both windows and mac platforms, with icons available in both mac and pc versions. gnomeskin skin 2 for winamp 3.x by nnic posted on 71702 1043pm   download    zoom    visit deskmod  get your copy of skinstudio xp gnomeaudio fight cloud unknown artists across a variety of genres offer free mp3 downloads of selected tracks, with an option to purchase songs on cd for the price of shipping and handling. all cds are professionally mastered works, so you're getting label quality releases, without the jackedup retail price tag. the mp3s let you decide if the album is worth you $4.95. the only thing i find odd about this site is their proclamation of paying artists 50% of distribution profits, which i have to assume is 50% of zero, since the cds are free. the artist selection contains some solid releases by talented artists, regardless. chris teaches the basics if you've got friends or family who want to learn more about their pc, from a guy who makes things nice and easy, check out the vhs release of computer basics in the gnomestore. chris teams with techtv cohort, kate botello, to lead novices on a journey through their computer. from basic interactions, to installing apps, to using the internet and email, chris and kate have all the basics covered. help out a friend and get them a copy today. gnomeplugin bbe sonic maximizer 3.22mb w9xw2kxp $129 from home recordings to downloaded mp3s, this directx plugin brings back the clarity to your audio files. bring back the live feel that gets lost in the recording process, add depth to bass lines, and bring vocals to the front of your audio mix where they belong. compensate for frequency phase shifting, giving your audio a kick in the pants. this is one post production tool you need in your digital arsenal. also available as a vst for mac os. gnomedvd click for details who's afraid of virginia woolf? (nr) 1966 adapted play  131min reviewer's tilt (10) before directing catch22 and the graduate, mike nichols made his big screen debut directing this adroit adaptation of edward albee's play ""who's afraid of virginia woolf?"" nominated for thirteen, and winner of five, academy awards, this dark tale centers on history professor george (richard burton), and his wife martha (elizabeth taylor), daughter of the college president. at first george and martha appear to be the average ozzie and harriet, an aging, welladjusted, educated couple, comfortable with their lives and their love. george and martha quickly shatter this illusion, as they return from a faculty cocktail party, to exchange a caustic barrage of verbal barbs. just as quickly, however, the couple turns witty and civil when the young new biology professor nick (george segal) and his shy, but pretty wife honey (sandy dennis) stop by for a nightcap. unfortunately for nick and honey, the sardonic exchange does not disappear, it merely changed guise. soon nick and honey find themselves helpless pawns in the elder couple's sickwitted exchange. throughout the remainder of the movie, george and martha dance their finely choreographed, oftrehearsed dance of despise. the two alternate the lead, alternately dishing out and enabling the abuse, but they never miss a step. thankfully, writer albee's sublime play translates to the big screen almost unadulterated. taylor and burton deliver his lines with great force and impeccable timing. at one point george proposes ""now that we're through with humiliate the host...and we don't want to play hump the hostess yet...how about a little round of get the guests?"" this provides some idea of the precarious twist of uncomfortable wit that drives the action from start to finish. albee's stellar writing notwithstanding, the real star of this film is taylor and burton's alchemy, converting albee's words into cinematic gold. ok, i will grant you that playing a pair of aging, drunk, selfish lovers may not have been much of a stretch. both actors, however, deliver their lines with the chilling reality of a serial killer describing his most gratifying slaying. often unpleasant and disturbing, this film never allows you to relax or look away. simultaneously seamlessly smooth, and ingeniously rocky this is not a ""feel good"" movie. ""who's afraid of virginia woolf?"" is, however, a memorable film that will stick with you for years to come. region 1 encoding (us and canada only) format black and white, widescreen anamorphic,

productivity tips now ! i did a lot this weekend, but i didn't really get much done, ya know? my knees are killing me from hauling stuff out of the basement for storage up in the attic, but the pile only made it as far as the kitchen. then i stripped and painted the floor where that collection of stuff was previously stored, and erected some shelving so i'd have room for more stuff. i woke up the next morning discover a very sick ferret, likely from the fumes that leeched into the next room over despite the ventilation i had setup to prevent the migration of bad air. so, i ended up dismantling the ferret cage to move it upstairs for a week or so until i'm sure it's safe. thankfully, all critters are doing well now. i also started in on replacing the cheapo rusted screws with stainless steel deck screws out back, but found that the ones i picked up are too weak, leaving me with stripped out heads and bent shafts. that project stopped after barely getting started. the front steps are also in need of rust proof screws, but they are made from much softer wood, so i moved the tools to the other side of the house. twothirds of the way through the first row, i found that the extra 12"" on the screws i purchased was too much and i began running into the top of the old concrete steps underneath. figures. live and learn. oh well, it was entirely too hot to work outside anyway. back down to the basement i went to geek out instead. roughly an hour into geekitude, i glanced over and realized it was 78.7 degrees in the basement and i was virtually stuck to my chair from the sweat. i shut off as much as i really could and still work on a couple of projects, but it didn't help the heat situation much. it was just too hot outside for the air conditioner to keep up with the added heat from the computers. that left me in need of a shower and with only the notebook in the living room for the balance of the weekend. i cleaned out a lot of ancient email, which was nice, but nothing really got accomplished otherwise. boy, am i tired. and the weekend is so far away. hey, the second season of mash comes out on dvd tomorrow! that should put me in better spirits. i could watch mash for hours on end. in fact, i often do just that. the only kink is that the episodes don't play backtoback from dvd. i'm going to play with applescript on the mac to see if i can customize how the individual discs play. in theory, i should be able to make a disc play all the way through. if i succeed, i'll be sure to share the script technique in the applecore newsletter . too bad i can't do that with a standalone dvd player. see you in august , randy nieland gnomenetwork slow file save dialog boxes pointed out by ian hargreaves i've hated this one for a long time, and now we have a hotfix and a workaround, so take your pick as to which will work best. i often map drive letters to specific network shares, and if i happen to have a system turned off, i'll notice a significant delay when clicking the dropdown boxes in open, look in or save inas dialog boxes. windows 2000 attempts to reconnect to mapped resources before showing you the list, and depending on how many drives you have mapped and how many of those resources are unavailable, it can take eons just to save a file. a workaround is to use the my network places functionality instead of mapping drive letters. fine for some, but i prefer having drive letters mapped for many things, being that i work at a command prompt quite a bit, and it's easier to navigate that way. alternatively, a hotfix is now available, but you'll have to contact microsoft to obtain the fix if that's the route you choose. gnomesystem customized 9xme blue screen errors we've all seen 'em. those annoyingly incoherent blue screens indicating a system error of some sort, but provide no real help in solving the problem. if you're a programmer that has had to deal with error conditions produced by windows 9598me, then this might be a better way to handle them within your applications. blue screen v1.21 is an activex control that uses the standard windows system error functions, but provides a way to pass along text and response options you designate. note that this is not functional on windows nt2000xp, which handle system errors in an entirely different manner. gamers beware of intel 845g chipset discount the amd hype and returned volley from intel when reading up on all of this, but one thing is painfully clear. the intel 845g chipset and p4 celeron processors really don't provide an acceptable gaming experience. not only is performance subject to ridicule, but compatibility is also looking to be a serious matter. intel has never claimed that celerons were highend desktop processors, but they have typically provided a decent enough experience that they can make for acceptable machines for the more budgetminded consumer. the compatibility issues with this particular version of celeron and the 845g chipset are something to watch out for. once the celeron is moved to the .13 micron core, i suspect the performance concern won't remain, but the 845g alone seems to have it's own problems without adding the celeron misery. the lesson in knowing what hardware you're buying is what's important here. gnomealertz today's top 5 kbalertz q296133  wd2002 recorded macro to create righttoleft

permanent damage. gnomestuff too cool this was just too interesting not to mention. watercooled systems are alltherage among overclockers and those that seem to need bragging rights over their friends' computer systems. hitachi is taking a chapter from that tome and applying the concept where it's truly needed  notebook computers. believe me when i say that these suckers get very hot. i spend half my life with notebook planted on lap, and i have to put something between the two surfaces to avoid my own little heat stroke. fans and the mini water cooling system hitachi is implementing provide roughly the same heat mitigation efficiency, but without the noise. the concept of a watercooled notebook sounds a little odd, but i would welcome the elimination of the turbine droning with open arms. recommend it! your subscribed email address is  to unsubscribe or change your delivery address, please visit the subscription management page. for further information, please refer to the

of the comments i received on applescript, every single one suggested i start with the basics, for that reason, i'm going to take things stepbystep, following my own learning process and progressing to gradually more difficult concepts. despite having experience in programming, using a variety of languages, i initially found applescript to be quite intimidating  mostly because something about the script editor seems less than intuitive. if you've already been dabbling in scripting, the first few columns on the subject will definitely be targeted at novices, but i want to everyone to have the chance to get up to speed. i'm off to the shareware industry conference for the remainder of the week, where it's looking like the selection of stuff for mac users will be very bleak. i believe the organization is targeted more toward the windows community in general and any shareware developer with enough cash to get there is probably going to be in new york for macworld. i'll be missing out on the web cast of steve jobs speech, which is scheduled to take place while i'm in the car, but at least i'll be able to catch the details at other mac sites when i get to st. louis. internet access for the trip is being provided by crosspaths.net, which is one of the few dialup services i've found that can be configured to relay my lockergnome mail so that i can still function on the road. i tested the service on my ibook this evening just to be sure. with some luck, i may be able to get internet access from the highway, via my kyocera 6035, and see what jobs had to say before i get to st. louis. unfortunately, there's no support for os x yet with the 6035, so i can't use the unlimited nights and weekends to dial the web from my laptop. a landline will probably be more sensible anyway. check my blog for some updates on the trip, lori's attending too and i'm sure she'll be taking lots of photos, as usual. see you in august , jake ludington gnomedownloads samex v2.0 1.73mb osx 10.1.1 free seven themes, two board sizes and your choice of difficulty levels, makes this a game for the entertainment addict in all of us. the object is to clear the board of all icons, removing them in matching clusters of two or greater at a time. clearing the screen awards bonus points and scoring awards clearing of larger clusters. nothing gets killed, there's no swearing, but you'll find yourself addicted to the mindless fun anyway  not to mention you can feel safe sharing this with kids. gnomenetwork samba sharing package v1.5 8.3mb os x free it remains to be seen whether 10.2 will render this type of application unnecessary, but for those out there without the cash to spend on dave, for small office or home networking of macpc mixed environments, this is the only real alternative. installation and configuration is almost painless, making it easy for your windows machine to see apps on your mac with little difficulty. the interface, like most os x gui apps, is quite easy to navigate, including user management, connection management, and share configuration into a convenient prefernce pane. gnomescript technically speaking, you could do most of your script writing in a text editing application like textedit, but ultimately you've got to compile it in the script editor, so you might as well start there. the script editor is located in the applescript subfolder of your applications folder. opening the application for the first time reveals a small window divided in to two sections, description and the actual scripting pane, separated by a group of buttons. ignore the buttons for the moment and concentrate on the two text panes. the description pane is where you label your script, so you can remember later what it does. this is also the place you denote the key combination that will invoke your script. if you choose to save your script as an executable application, the information in the description will show up in the start up screen. the second pane is where the magic happens. in this pane you will be telling applications to do specific tasks when your script runs. the format for scripting is fairly linear. you either start your script at the top most level drilling down, until you actually reach the application or object you want to manipulate with your script, or you take the reverse approach manipulating things from the bottom up. telling the ""applications"" folder to tell its ""jake"" subfolder to tell the application ""jake's media player,"" located in that folder to do something could also be written by telling the script to access ""jake's media player"" located in the ""jake"" subfolder of the ""applications folder, the upcoming example will make this a bit more clear. buy one inkjet cartridge  get two free!!

""free internet downloads are good for the music industry and its artists,"" explains ian. ""every act that can't get signed to a major, for whatever reason, can reach literally millions of new listeners, enticing them to buy the cd and come to the concerts."" she adds that during the heyday of napster she saw a marked increase in cd sales from her website. she attacks technological and political measures meant to harm consumers by restricting their right to copy and back up their legally purchased music. ian will play on august 17 in san rafael, ca. during her 17 album career, ian has earned nine grammy nominations and three awards. her best known songs include 1967's ""society's child"" and 1975's ""at seventeen."" more recently, her 1993 album ""breaking silence"" was nominated for a grammy award as contemporary folk album of the year. her songs have been recorded by artists ranging from bette midler to cher, from glen campbell to vanilla fudge, and from joan baez to etta james. links for this release janis ian's ""internet debacle"" article janis ian's followup article janis ian's tour information  end   eff cafe 2002  a benefit for eff's campaign for audiovisual free expression support free expression and see barneywheaton deathmatch thursday, august 22nd, 2002 9pm  afterhours san francisco  join the hottest djs of the electronic dance music scene, celebrity boxers, and the foremost cyberspace activists as we party to protect the future of music. the electronic frontier foundation presents cafe 2002  a benefit for eff's campaign for audiovisual free expression at 9 p.m. on thursday, august 22nd, 2002 at the dna lounge in san francisco. admission is on a sliding scale and begins at $10. the night features worldclass djs, live acts, and producers from all parts of the fastgrowing electronic music community and a special treat celebrity boxing with wil wheaton and barney the purple dinosaur! wil wheaton, of star trek the next generation and stand by me fame, will take on barney in a celebrity boxing matchup for the history books. all proceeds from the event will directly benefit eff's cafe project, helping to preserve your freedom to express yourself in innovative ways. for more information, see or contact katina bishop director of education and offline activism electronic frontier foundation 4154369333 x101  end   join the fun at eff's vip party with wil wheaton! did you lovehate him on star trek the next generation?

""c"", not in this sample, has the same problem.  ""qu"" are set right up against each other, with insufficient whitespace between them.  ""m"" is distinctly asymmetric.  the enclosed loop of ""a"" looks muddy, as it is partially filled with grey. contrast with ""a"" drawn without the bytecode interpreter, which has a nice clear open loop. ick. perhaps this is why red hat turned the bytecode interpreter off. it may improve nonantialiased rendering, but only at the expense of making a mess of antialiased rendering. this may come down to a matter of personal aesthetics, but for my part, i'm going back to red hat's standard packages with the bytecode interpreter turned off.",[],1902,0,0,hard_ham_testing

been done yet. we have made more progress in the testing system. other details of the changes made in the new version will be at the beginning of the book. the book is due at the end of october. the

gnulinux from frederick noronha india there's good news round the corner  international organisations and prominent networks worldwide are waking up to the rich potential of freeopen source software, a field that is slowly being recognised for the immense promise it holds out to the third world. but can this be tapped speedily enough and effectively? from the unesco to the world bank, and other global organisations, all are catching up on the potential of using gnulinux as a potent tool in working towards development. more so in countries where the cost of a proprietorial office suite could eat up six months or more of the average citizen's earnings. united nation's development programme's ms. radhika lal a informationcommunication technology policy advisor, recently drew attention to a conference on open source for egovernment. it is to be held in washington, dc on october 1718. infodev, the cyberspace policy institute of the george washington university, and the undp are jointly behind this event. it is intended to draw participants from local, national and international organizations from both the public and private sector. this meet intends to present cases of 'best practices', raise awareness about the potential of open source and free software for egovernance. more importantly, it will be sharing experiences among policy makers, donors, users and consumers, universities, and industry specialists in open source, egovernment and related fields. ms lal works at the ictfordevelopment's special initiative bureau for development policy at the undp's east 45th street offices in new york. ictfordevelopment is a campaign to use more of infotech and the internet for global development and fighting problems like poverty and illiteracy. but despite quite a few shared goals and concerns with the gnulinux world, so far little networking has been done between these two separate circles. see other arms of the u.n.  besides, the undp, other arms of the united nations are also known to be showing increasing interest in the potential of free softwareopen source tools. parisheadquartered unesco (united nations education, scientific and cultural organisation) recently launched its own free software portal. it's at unesco's jeanclaude dauphin of the information society division also announced that this international organisation has been looking out for contributors with a good knowledge of the free software movement in relation with unesco fields of competence  education, science and culture. it zeroed in particularly on those coming from the third world (also called the 'south' countries) who could could make propositions for ""revising, updating and extending the unesco free software portal"" as well as for including new basic documents. ""this work could be done using a fee or consultant contract and the fee can be discussed depending on the amount of work described in the contract,"" said dauphin. check out the sites at unesco libraries portal ( unesco archives portal ( unesco free software portal ( unesco observatory on the information society ( new tools for cdsisis  recently, unesco also announced the launch of new tools for data exchange from and to its cdsisis software. these two new tools  impexp2709 and isisascii v 0.92  have recently been released for data exchange from and to unesco's software package cdsisis. cdsisis is a generalized information storage and retrieval system that is freely distributed, and has attracted users in places like libraries within the third world. the new utilities have been released with their source code (gpl license). see meanwhile, undp's apdip (asiapacific development information programme) based in kuala lumpur, malaysia, is also learnt to be thinking seriously about organizing some kind of a consultation on open source, gnulinux and related issues. ""we want to see how we can further this cause in the region,"" apdip's shahid akhtar told this correspondent. niranjan rajani of pakistani origin but based in the birthplace of linux, finland, is now working on a research project on ""significance of freeopensource software for developing countries"". this project is financed by the finnish foreign ministry, and he has undertaken to write the paper by the end of november this year, for maailma.net, a local division of oneworld.net. this project's goal is to find out, evaluate and analyze the extent of use of fsoss, especially some of its most significant and popular projects gnulinux, apache, mozilla, openoffice etc. in the developing or third world countries. it will also look at its possible impact on economies, societies and lives of these countries. convincing governments  in india, organisations like red hat have been putting out slick presentations to convince governments and officials to try out open source. shift over boldly to the world of 'open source' and 'free' software. that's the message that governments across india were recently with, as official computerisation efforts get bogged down due to spiraling software costs and speedy softwarefuelled hardware obsolence. senior it and egovernance officials from across the country tuned in attentively during a recent seminar in goa, as executives from computing giant ibm and leading linux systems supplier red hat india narrated long lists of benefits that governments could get from going the linux way. pointing to examples from across the globe, red hat india argued that the us department of energy has built supercomputers on gnulinux, the chinese are making linux the official server operating system  to be widely used in varsities, military installations and within government. some months back, an organisation under india's ministry of information technology  called the erdci (electronics research and development centre of india)  entered into a strategic alliance with leading linux systems supplier red hat india to popularize the 'open source' solution in the government sector. on networks like the edcworld banksupport gkd (global knowledge for development), issues of free software and open source often make it to the news. gnulinux is a suitable tool in organising too, as it was recently pointed out. (see ""the low income networking and communication (linc) project of the welfare law center has helped many lowincome led organizing groups acquire access to the internet and use technology more effectively,"" says dirk slater while these groups have increased their abilities to communicate with one another and their allies by using the internet, one communication hurdle remains  communicating with their leadership via the internet. despite many ""digital divide"" initiatives addressing access to the internet in lowincome communities, access is still an issue. public internet access points, such as libraries and schools, are not sufficient, as slater has pointed out. many lowincome leaders do not have access to the internet where it would make the most impact  in their homes. linc argues that the need for internet communication is particularly great for rural groups whose members live far apart and cannot have frequent facetoface meetings because of distance, time and money constraints. ""we began to explore the idea of using linux, a free operating system that works well on older computers, when we learned of microsoft's decision to discontinue support of its older operating systems like windows 95 according to slater, who is 'senior circuit rider' for the lowincome networking and communications (linc) project at the welfare law center. linc protagonists say they had also been ""troubled"" by the frequent problems that occur for windows users just by having windows run on its own. ""giving a person who lives in a rural area an older computer with windows seemed like we were just asking for trouble. we also attempted to identify similar projects but had limited success,"" says slater. linc wanted to increase its ability to provide stable desktop systems using donated computers for board members and leaders of lowincome led organizations that linc serves. ""our goal is to increase the ability of linc project partner groups to use opensource software to support their organizing work. we also wanted to document the project as much as we possibly could, so we could provide details of our experiences for others doing similar projects,"" linc explains. linc identified a partner in grass roots organizing in mexico, mo, and installed gnulinux on 10 computers used as standalone workstations in people's homes. gnulinux was also installed on a brand new standalone computer to work as the main computer in the gro office. links were built with the mizzou linux users group for ongoing local support. ""we still have a long way to go before we can call this a completely successful project. after a period of a few months we will assess whether the board members are actually using the computers to communicate more effectively,"" said slater. to view the daily journals on the project with gro please visit the linc project linux pages at  need to network  bala pillai who was earlier based in malaysia and now in sydneyaustralia, is founder of tamil innaiyam ( an organisation to promote the tamil language worldwide. he points to the impact gnulinux is making in some distant areas of the third world. says pillai ""the most interactive open sourcelinux community in our time zoneasia springs out of the philippines. primarily because the filipino psyche is a more secure psyche, a more selfconfident psyche. ""folks who are selfconfident worry about the future less, and allocate more time diagnosing and solving problems rather than echoing and reechoing it. filipinos are also more into sharing and online sharing  we should look to more symbiosis with them,"" says he. pillai also notes that the manilabased miguel paraz, whom he interacted with since 1996, is a key catalyst in the filipino linux community. "" is a good starting point to get a feel for the key open source catalysts in the philippines,"" says he. kuala lumpur, malaysiabased dinesh who runs is another lead open source catalyst from the region, explains pillai. ""do look for symbiosis opportunities there too,"" he suggests. ""i see lots of room for us to symbiosis together. for example, there is likely to be areas where we diagnosing, documenting, analyzing, coding or publicizing where there is overduplication. if we coordinated ourselves and found out where our circles and priorities intersect , we could share this work and get fruits out faster,"" he adds.  frederick noronha  freelance journalist  goa  india 832.409490  409783 bytesforall  gnulinux email  mobile 9822 122436 (goa)  saligao goa india writing with a difference... on what makes the difference   send submissions for comp.os.linux.announce to   please remember a short description of the software and the location.   this group is archived at    from frederick noronha subject attn programmers support offered flosssarai initiative date 8 sep 2002 012545 gmt dear friends, can we manage to get some money into backing freelibre open source software initiatives, that would help young volunteers out there to support their cashstrapped initiatives? sarai.net, a delhibased initiative under the csds (centre for the study of developing societies) has been solidly supportive of such an idea. jeebesh bagchi sent in this offer recently. it could surely be of help particularly to college students and others wanting to make a break in free softwareopen source, but hamstrung by resources. it might help if projects are initially kept small and definitely workable, i guess. this is my own gutlevel feeling, but maybe bigger initiatives which are clearly workable could also prove convincing. if such experiments prove useful, maybe there would be a good case for greater support to free softwareopen source developers in regions like ours. fn  forwarded message  the sarai programme, centre for the study of developing societies, delhi ( invites applications for support grants to projects in the area of free software, open source software and social usage of software sarai invites programmers (practictioners as well as students) to propose projects in the area of free and open source software applications relevant to educational, social and community needs. we are looking for original ideas, as well as proposals to localize and adapt existing software and applications to south asian conditions, for example  desktops in hindi, open office and gimp in hindi. lighter versions of desktops like kde, innovations that creatively optimises older lower configuration machines, linux documentation in hindi, games using local context, etc. what is sarai sarai is a public initiative of media practitioners and scholars looking at media cultures and urban life. sarai's interests are in the field of old and new media, information and communication technologies, free software, cinema, and urban space  its politics, built form, ecology, culture and history, with a strong commitment to making knowledge available in the public domain. it is a programme of the centre for the study of developing societies, delhi. for more information visit sarai is committed to promoting the free software and open source vision. conditions applicants should be resident in india, and should have a bank account in any bank operating in india. these are support grants and grantees will be free to pursue their primary occupations, if any. mail your project proposal, workplan and cv to both the following addresses with a copy to please mark your subjectline 'floss (freelibre open source software) initiative'. also point out what you see as the relevance of your work, and how you plan to share the resultant software once finalised. enquires last date for submission october 15th, 2002. note proposals from teams, partnerships, collectives, faculty are welcome, so long as the grant amount is administered by a single individual, and the funds are deposited in a single bank account in the name of an individual.    send submissions for comp.os.linux.announce to   please remember a short description of the software and the location.   this group is archived at     for your reference  the service address, to which questions about the list itself and requests to be added to or deleted from it should be directed, is internet you can submit announcements to be moderated via internet linux may be obtained via one of these ftp sites ftp.funet.fi publinux tsx11.mit.edu publinux sunsite.unc.edu publinux end of linuxannounce digest",[],28700,0,0,hard_ham_testing

(your results might differ depending on your machine characteristics, but you should see a distinct difference in the result for arraylist as compared to that for linkedlist . the same is true for the other programs in this tip.) clearly, linkedlist is a bad choice in this situation. the binary search algorithm inherently uses random access, and linkedlist does not support fast random access. the time to do a random access in a linkedlist is proportional to the size of the list. by comparison, random access in an arraylist has a fixed time. you can use the randomaccess marker interface to check whether a list supports fast random access void f(list lst)  if (lst instanceof randomaccess)   supports fast random access   arraylist implements the randomaccess interface, and linkedlist . does not. note that collections.binarysearch does take advantage of the randomaccess property, to optimize searches. do these results prove that arraylist is always a better choice? not necessarily. there are many cases where linkedlist does better. also note that there are many situations where an algorithm can be implemented efficiently for linkedlist . an example is reversing a linkedlist using collections.reverse . the internal algorithm does this, and gets reasonable performance, by using forward and backward iterators. let's look at another example. suppose you have a list of elements, and you do a lot of element inserting and deleting to the list. in this case, linkedlist is the better choice. to demonstrate that, consider the following ""worst case"" scenario. in this demo, a program repeatedly inserts elements at the beginning of a list. the code looks like this import java.util. public class listdemo2  static final int n  50000  time how long it takes to add  n objects to a list static long timelist(list lst)  long start  system.currenttimemillis() object obj  new object() for (int i  0 i  n i)  lst.add(0, obj)  return system.currenttimemillis()  start  public static void main(string args)   do timing for arraylist system.out.println( ""time for arraylist  ""  timelist(new arraylist()))  do timing for linkedlist system.out.println( ""time for linkedlist  ""  timelist(new linkedlist()))   when you run this program, the result should look something like this time for arraylist  4859 time for linkedlist  125 these results are pretty much the reverse of the previous example. when an element is added to the beginning of an arraylist , all of the existing elements must be pushed back, which means a lot of expensive data movement and copying. by contrast, adding an element to the beginning of a linkedlist simply means allocating an internal record for the element and then adjusting a couple of links. adding to the beginning of a linkedlist has fixed cost, but adding to the beginning of an arraylist has a cost that's proportional to the list size. so far, this tip has looked at speed issues, but what about space? let's look at some internal details of how arraylist and linkedlist are implemented in java 2 sdk, standard edition v 1.4. these details are not part of the external specification of these classes, but are illustrative of how such classes work internally. the linkedlist class has a private internal class defined like this private static class entry  object element entry next entry previous  each entry object references a list element, along with the next and previous elements in the linkedlist  in other words, a doublylinked list. a linkedlist of 1000 elements will have 1000 entry objects linked together, referencing the actual list elements. there is significant space overhead in a linkedlist structure, given all these entry objects. an arraylist has a backing object array to store the elements. this array starts with a capacity of 10. when the array needs to grow, the new capacity is computed as newcapacity  (oldcapacity  3)  2  1 notice that the array capacity grows each time by about 50%. this means that if you have an arraylist with a large number of elements, there will be a significant amount of space wasted at the end. this waste is intrinsic to the way arraylist works. if there was no spare capacity, the array would have to be reallocated for each new element, and performance would suffer dramatically. changing the growth strategy to be more aggressive (such as doubling the size at each reallocation) would result in slightly better performance, but it would waste more space. if you know how many elements will be in an arraylist , you can specify the capacity to the constructor. you can also call the trimtosize method after the fact to reallocate the internal array. this gets rid of the wasted space. so far, this discussion has assumed that either an arraylist or a linkedlist is ""right"" for a given application. but sometimes, other choices make more sense. for example, consider the very common situation where you have a list of keyvalue pairs, and you would like to retrieve a value for a given key. you could store the pairs in an n x 2 object array. to find the right pair, you could do a sequential search on the key values. this approach works, and is a useful choice for very small lists (say 10 elements or less), but it doesn't scale to big lists. another approach is to sort the keyvalue pairs by ascending key value, store the result in a pair of arraylists , and then do a binary search on the keys list. this approach also works, and is very fast. yet another approach is to not use a list structure at all, but instead use a map structure (hash table), in the form of a hashmap . which is faster, a binary search on an arraylist , or a hashmap ? here's a final example that compares these two import java.util. public class listdemo3  static final int n  500000  lists of keys and values static list keys static list values  fill the keys list with ascending order key  values and fill the values list with  corresponding values (key) static  integer keyvec  new integern integer valuevec  new integern random rn  new random() for (int i  0, currval  0 i  n i)  keyveci  new integer(currval) valueveci  new integer(currval) currval  rn.nextint(100)  1  keys  arrays.aslist(keyvec) values  arrays.aslist(valuevec)   fill a map with keyvalue pairs static map map  new hashmap() static  for (int i  0 i  n i)  map.put(keys.get(i), values.get(i))    do binary search lookup of all keys static long timelist()  long start  system.currenttimemillis() for (int i  0 i  n i)  int indx  collections.binarysearch( keys, keys.get(i))  sanity check of returned value  from binary search if (indx ! i)  system.out.println( "" error n"")   return system.currenttimemillis()  start   do map lookup of all keys static long timemap()  long start  system.currenttimemillis() for (int i  0 i  n i)  integer value  (integer)map.get( keys.get(i))  sanity check of value returned  from map lookup if (value ! values.get(i))  system.out.println( "" error n"")   return system.currenttimemillis()  start  public static void main(string args)   do timing for list implementation system.out.println(""list time  ""  timelist())  do timing for map implementation system.out.println(""map time  ""  timemap())   the program sets up lists of keys and values, and then uses two different techniques to map keys to values. one approach uses a binary search on a list, the other a hash table. when you run the listdemo3 program, you should get a result that looks something like this arraylist time  1000 hashmap time  281 in this example, n has a value of 500000. approximately, log2(n)  1 comparisons are required in an average successful binary search, so each binary search lookup in the arraylist will take about 18 comparisons. by contrast, a properly implemented hash table typically requires only 13 comparisons. so you should expect the hash table to be faster in this case. however, binary search is still useful. for example, you might want to do a lookup in a sorted list and then find keys that are close in value to the key used for the lookup. doing this is easy with binary search, but impossible in a hash table. keys in a hash table are stored in apparent random order. also, if you are concerned with worstcase performance, the binary search algorithm offers a much stronger performance guarantee than a hash table scheme. you might also consider using treemap for doing lookups in sorted collections of keyvalue pairs. let's summarize the key points presented in this tip appending elements to the end of a list has a fixed averaged cost for both arraylist and linkedlist. for arraylist , appending typically involves setting an internal array location to the element reference, but occasionally results in the array being reallocated. for linkedlist , the cost is uniform and involves allocating an internal entry object. inserting or deleting elements in the middle of an arraylist implies that the rest of the list must be moved. inserting or deleting elements in the middle of a linkedlist has fixed cost. a linkedlist does not support efficient random access an arraylist has space overhead in the form of reserve capacity at the end of the list. a linkedlist has significant space overhead per element. sometimes a map structure is a better choice than a list . for more information about using arraylist and linkedlists , see section 16.6, list, and section 16.7, map and sortedmap, in "" the java tm programming language third edition "" by arnold, gosling, and holmes. also see the collections trail in the java tutorial, third edition . back to top using zerolength arrays suppose that you are writing a java application that involves some sort of data filtering. you have some raw data that you want to clean up and process in various ways. one of the methods you've written takes an array of integers, along with minimum and maximum values. the method goes through the array and eliminates ""outliers,"" that is, values that are too small or too big. the result of the filtering process is a new array of cleanedup data. how could you implement this kind of filtering method? here's one approach import java.util. public class zerodemo1   filter input array and throw away values  that are less than minval or greater than  maxval static int filterdata( int indata, int minval, int maxval)   check parameters for errors if (indata  null)  throw new nullpointerexception( ""indata is null"")  if (maxval  minval)  throw new illegalargumentexception( ""maxval  minval"")   count number of valid values  in input array int validcnt  0 for (int i  0 i  indata.length i)  if (indatai  minval  indatai  maxval)  validcnt    if no valid values, return null if (validcnt  0)  return null   copy valid values to new array  and return it int outdata  new intvalidcnt for (int i  0, j  0 i  indata.length i)  if (indatai  minval  indatai  maxval)  outdataj  indatai   return outdata  public static void main(string args)   set up test array of integers int indata  new int1, 3, 17, 8, 59  filter out values not in the range 110 int outdata1  filterdata(indata, 1, 10) for (int i  0 i  outdata1.length i)  system.out.println(outdata1i)   filter out values not  in the range 100200 int outdata2  filterdata( indata, 100, 200) for (int i  0 i  outdata2.length i)  system.out.println(outdata2i)    the filterdata method does two scans of the input array. the first scan counts the number of valid data values. then the method allocates a new array of the appropriate size, and copies the good values to it. if there are no good values, the method returns a null value for the array reference. the result of running the zerodemo1 program is 1 3 8 exception in thread ""main"" java.lang.nullpointerexception at zerodemo1.main(zerodemo1.java72) the problem with this program is a rather basic one. the second call of filterdata returns a null value, and the program fails to take this possibility into account. a better approach in this example would be to comment out the block of code that tests for the possibility of no valid data values  if (validcnt  0)  return null   when there is no valid data, the code will fall through to the next line, where a zerolength array is allocated int outdata  new int0 this is perfectly legal java usage. the representation of java arrays includes the length of the array, and it's therefore possible to tell if an array has zero length. for the zerodemo1 example, if you anticipate that validcnt will often be zero, that is, data filtering will often eliminate all values from the input, then you could optimize away the second input scan by adding code like this int outdata  new intvalidcnt if (validcnt  0)  return outdata  note that usage such as int outdata  new int is also legal, to initialize an array with a zerolength set of integer constants. in general, it's best not to return null from a method that returns an array type. always returning an array, even if the array has zero length, greatly improves the generality of algorithms. if you anticipate that your methods will often return zerolength arrays, you might be concerned about the performance implications of allocating many such arrays. in this case, you can allocate a single array, and always return the same one, as follows private static final int zerolengtharray  new int0 this array is immutable (it can't be changed), and can be shared throughout your application. there's another way that zerolength arrays are used, as illustrated in the following example import java.util. public class zerodemo2  public static void main(string args)   set up arraylist and add strings to it list stringlist  new arraylist() stringlist.add(""string 1"") stringlist.add(""string 2"") stringlist.add(""string 3"")  convert to string array string out  ( string)stringlist.toarray( new string0) for (int i  0 i  out.length i)  system.out.println(outi)    the result of running the zerodemo2 program is string 1 string 2 string 3 the zerodemo2 program sets up an arraylist , and adds three strings to it. then the program calls toarray to get a string array of the three elements in the arraylist . in this example, the argument to toarray is ""new string0"". this argument serves a couple of purposes. first, if you have a string array that's big enough to hold the elements of the arraylist , you can specify it as the argument to toarray . the method will use the string array. but if your array is not big enough, then the toarray method allocates an array to return the elements. it uses the type of the array that was passed in to determine the type of the allocated array. arraylist stores its element references in an object array. the toarray method needs to be told if there is some other type (such as string) to be used for returning the array of elements. the method uses reflection ( java.lang.reflect.array.newinstance ) to create an array of the appropriate type. for more information about using zerolength arrays, see item 27 ""return zerolength arrays, not nulls"" in ""

the umbrella stand? the theatrics that make the corporate crime beat great? we're kidding (mostly), but that could be why overseas outlets barely noticed this comparatively tame example of american excess. the journal had one amusing tidbit, though after keller got fired, aol vice chairman ted leonsis hired him as a consultant for the hockey team the washington capitals, of which leonsis is the majority owner. leonsis said he let keller go after finding out why he lost his aol job, but keller still picked up his capitals phone as of wednesday. as outrageous severance packages go, it's no jack welshge $9 million annual pension, but it'll have to do.  jen muehlbauer homestore executives agree to guilty pleas homestore, aol ad deals yield guilty pleas (usa today) u.s. focuses on executive at homestore homestore's exexecs to aid investigators probe of homestore turns to an exaol executive (paid registration required.) jack welch's very golden years glengarry glen ross  advertisement  what's really going on at microsoft?

the media can't figure it out. can ceo jeanrene fourtou? his fuzziness at yesterday's board meeting got reporters to wondering. if he can't explain his vision, does that mean he's lacking the 2020 clarity that observers on two continents were banking on? for fourtou, worse than the monsieur magoo accusations are the comparisons, starting to bubble through media accounts, that he resembles  wait, we're rubbing our eyes  the vilified jeanmarie messier. media watchers can rate reporters' confusion over fourtou's latest pronouncements by tallying the amount of space outlets devoted to their coverage of the mess. the new york times ran 24 paragraphs on the board meeting  and then filed another 19 in an analysis that sought to examine what the latest moves meant. the financial times posted two articles on the meeting and still had more to say, lambasting fourtou in lex, the peach paper's influential column. lex called the exec's update ""more like a rambling fireside chat ... than a strategy presentation."" there's little that's clear about what's ahead for vivendi. the company now says that it will dispose of 12 billion euros worth of assets over the next 18 months. here's how reporters examining the tea leaves read the current plan out are telepiu, an italian paytv operation, and canal plus technologies, a maker of settop boxes. on the way out are vivendi's publishing properties, which include houghton mifflin, and a minority stake in a pc gamemaker. that leaves vivendi's stake in telecom, via its cegetel investment, and its universal entertainment properties, and  hey, wait a minute, wasn't that messier's plan, the new york times wondered by way of an analyst's quote. to confuse matters further, news corp., the alleged partner in the done deal for telepiu, says no deal is in place, according to the financial times. as for cegetel, fourtou said he'd consider selling vivendi's 44% stake then again, maybe he'll increase it. and that was all in one postmeeting telephone conference. the only decision by vivendi in which fourtou seemed sure was his claim that the company won't pay any severance to messier. ""he enjoyed making deals too much and overpaid,"" the guardian quoted fourtou as saying, and then adding, ""this all went to his head."" with heads other than messier's now in question, is vivendi's viability again in doubt? outlets today report that enron's logo, the oversize capital ""e"" that stood outside its headquarters, sold at auction for $44,000. how many euros might a v bring?  deborah asbrand vivendi will move quickly to sell many assets what's new at vivendi? depends who's talking vivendi in move to sell raft of assets (financial times) vivendi board to deny messier severance pay (financial times) lex vivendi universal (financial times) news corp counters report of telepiu sale (financial times) vivendi aims to realise eu12bn from asset sales (daily telegraph) messier 'won't get a penny' vivendi shakes up board, denies messier's severance enron auctions off furniture and famous 'e'  other stories  hp boosts layoffs by 1,800 former worldcom controller to plead guilty to two counts (wall street journal) tyco rewarded an executive during a grand jury inquiry bell labs researcher falsified experiments (ap) germany's neuer markt to close resources dry up as joblessness drags on (usa today) merrill aide to plead guilty (wall street journal) enron excfo clears his throat for feds music labels seek piracy payback  do you want to reach the net's savviest audience? advertise in media unspun. contact erik vanderkolk for details at today.  staff  written by deborah asbrand keith dawson jen muehlbauer and lori patel copyedited by jim duffy advertising erik vanderkolk editor and publisher jimmy guterman media unspun is produced by the vineyard group inc. copyright 2002 media unspun, inc., and the vineyard group, inc. subscribe already, willya? redistribution by email is permitted as long as a link to is included.  powered by to be removed from this list, use this link to receive future messages in html format, use this link to change your subscriber information, use this link","['http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/business/26ENRO.html', 'mailto:jimduffy86@yahoo.com', 'http://www.chron.com/cs/CDA/story.hts/tech/news/1591103', 'http://www.fool.com/news/Take/2002/mft/mft02090903.htm', 'http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-napster26sep26001431,0,388519.story', 'http://tinyurl.com/1ncs', '#a96666', 'mailto:dawson@world.std.com', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/change.cfm?x=mediaunspun%2Czzz-unspun@example.com%2Ctxt', 'http://guterman.com', 'http://tinyurl.com/1ncq', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/mod_input_proc.cfm?mod_name=tell_friend_form&XXDESXXuser=mediaunspun&XXDESXXthanks=Thank%20You%2E&XXDESXXsubject=Check%20this%20out%3A%20%5B%5Btitle%5D%5D&XXDESXXheading=&XXDESXXbackto=http://newsletter.mediaunspun.com/index000020868.cfm&XXDESXXissue_id=20868&XXDESXXtitle=Media%20Unspun', 'http://tinyurl.com/1ncw', '#a96667', 'http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-vivendi26sep26,0,481695.story', 'http://www.imakenews.com/affiliate.cfm?a_id=unspun', 'http://online.wsj.com/article/0,,SB1032971619118707713,00.html', 'http://media.guardian.co.uk/city/story/0,7497,799283,00.html', 'mailto:dasbrand@world.std.com', 'mailto:guterman@vineyard.com', 'http://newsletter.mediaunspun.com', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/technology/26AOL.html', 'http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/2283068.stm', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/update.cfm?x=mediaunspun%2Czzz-unspun@example.com', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/business/26PLAC.html', 'http://www.imakenews.com', 'https://ziffdavis.omeda.com/zm/msw/msw.cgi?intro2&p=5UCXA00075', 'http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A3165-2002Sep25.html', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/business/26VIVE.html', 'http://www.mediaunspun.com/subscribe.html', 'http://tinyurl.com/1nc1', 'http://tinyurl.com/1nd0', 'http://www.nypost.com/business/57905.htm', 'http://www.imakenews.com/eletra/remove.cfm?x=mediaunspun%2Czzz-unspun@example.com', 'http://www.nytimes.com/2002/09/26/business/26PAY.html', 'mailto:jen@englishmajor.com', 'mailto:loripatel@hotmail.com', 'http://www.cowpokeproductions.com', '#a96668', 'http://www.latimes.com/business/la-fi-homestore26sep26,0,5107257.story', 'http://www.poptech.org', 'http://www.mediaunspun.com', 'http://www.siliconvalley.com/mld/siliconvalley/4151819.htm', 'http://www.msnbc.com/news/813048.asp', 'http://www.msnbc.com/news/813195.asp?0dm=B21AB', 'mailto:erikvanderkolk@yahoo.com', 'http://us.imdb.com/Title?0104348', 'http://tinyurl.com/1nbz', 'http://tinyurl.com/1ncy']",11695,49,0,hard_ham_testing
