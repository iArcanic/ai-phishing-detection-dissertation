""i pick up a fitness mag, i start to laugh and i wipe my arse with it,"" is the opening paragraph penned by bronson. ""its a joke and a big con and they call me a criminal!"" you cant help feeling he has a point. this is not the first book that bronson has written from behind bars, having already published birdman opens his mind, which features drawings and poems created by bronson while in prison. and he is not the first prisoner to discover creative expression while residing at her majestys pleasure. jimmy boyle, the scots sculptor and novelist, discovered his artistic talents when he was sent to barlinnie prisons famous special unit, which aimed to help inmates put their violent pasts behind them by teaching them how to express their emotions artistically. boyle was sentenced to life for the murder of ""babs"" rooney in 1967. once released, he moved to edinburgh where he has become a respected artist. his first novel, hero of the underworld, was published in 1999 and his autobiography, a sense of freedom, was made into an awardwinning film. hugh collins was jailed for life in 1977 for the murder of william mooney in glasgow, and in his first year in barlinnie prison stabbed three prison officers, earning him an extra sevenyear sentence. but, after being transferred to the same unit that boyle attended, he learned to sculpt and developed an interest in art. he later published autobiography of a murderer, a frank account of glasgows criminal culture in the 1960s, which received critical praise. and lord archer doesnt seem to have had trouble continuing to write the books that have made him millions while in jail. he recently signed a threebook deal with macmillan publishers worth a reported 10 million, and is no doubt scribbling away as we speak. so why is it that men like collins, bronson and boyle, who can be so destructive towards society on the outside, can become so creative once stuck on the inside? steve richards, bronsons publisher, has published many books about criminal figures and believes the roots of this phenomenon are both pragmatic and profound. he says ""prison is sometimes the first time some criminals will ever have known a stable environment, and this can be the first time they have the chance to focus on their creative skills. ""it may also be the first time that they have really had the chance of an education, if their early years have been hard. it could be the first time anyone has offered them the chance to explore their creative talents."" however, richards believes the reasons are also deeper than that. he says ""once they are behind bars, the cold light of day hits them, and they examine the very essence of who they are. ""they ask themselves, am i a man who wants to be remembered for violence? or am i a man who can contribute to society, who can be remembered for something good?"" bronson  who was born michael gordon peterson, but changed his name to that of the hollywood star of the death wish films  has, so far, been remembered mainly for things bad. he was originally jailed for seven years for armed robbery in 1974, and has had a series of sentences added to his original term over the years as a result of attacking people in prison. in 2000 he was jailed for life after being convicted of holding a teacher hostage for nearly two days during a jail siege. standing five feet ten and a half inches tall and weighing 210lbs, he is renowned for his strength. he has bent metal cell doors with his bare hands and does up to 3,000  yes, 3,000  pressups a day. as he puts it ""i can hit a man 20 times in four seconds, i can push 132 press ups in 60 seconds."" but judging by our current obsession with health and exercise, solitary fitness might be the book which will see bronsons face sitting on every coffee table in the land. he might be the man to give us the dream body which so many socalled fitness gurus promise but fail to motivate us into. because bronson has learned to use words as powerfully as he can use his fists. ""all this crap about highprotein drinks, pills, diets, its just a load of bollocks and a multimillionpound racket,"" he writes, in what can only be described as a refreshingly honest style.

profile of the fcc commissioner fer crissakes! so the following article comes recommended, a fine explanation of michael powell's extraordinary equivocation. on the other hand, i can also agree with werbach's werblog entry... rohit  a trip to f.c.c. world   nicholas lemann has a piece in the new yorker this week about fcc  chairman michael powell. it's one of the first articles i've seen that  captures some of powell's real personality, and the way he's viewed in  washington. unfortunately, lemann ends by endorsing conventional  political wisdom. after describing how powell isn't really a  firebreathing ideological conservative, he concludes that, in essence,  powell favors the inumbent local bell telephone companies, while a  democratic fcc would favor new entrants. i know that's not how powell  sees the world, and though i disagree with him on many issues, i think  he's right to resist the old dichotomy.   the telecom collapse should be a humbling experience for anyone who  went through it. the disaster wasn't the regulators' fault, as some  conservatives argue. but something clearly went horribly wrong, and  policymakers should learn from that experience. contrary to lemann's  speculation, the upstart carriers won't be successful in a gore  administration, because it's too late. virtually all of them are dead,  and wall street has turned off the capital tap for the foreseeable  future. some may survive, but as small players rather than  worlddominators.   the battle between clecs and rbocs that lemann so astutely parodies is  old news. the next important battle in telecom will be between those  who want to stay within the traditional boxes, and those who use  different models entirely. that's why open broadband networks and open  spectrum are so important. whatever the regulatory environment, there  is going to be consolidation in telecom. those left out in that  consolidation will face increasing pressure to create new pipes into  the home, or slowly die. the victors in the consolidation game will cut  back on innovation and raise prices, which will create further pressure  for alternatives.   lemann is right that policymaking looks much drier and more ambiguous  on the ground than through the lens of history. but he's wrong in  thinking that telecom's future will be something like its past.   friday, october 04, 2002  111711 am comments 0  the chairman by nicholas lemann he's the other powell, and no one is sure what he's up to. new yorker, october 8, 2002 last year, my middle son, in eighth grade and encountering his first fairly serious americanhistory course, indignantly reported that the whole subject was incomprehensible. i was shocked. what about gettysburg and the declaration of independence and the selmatomontgomery march? just look at my textbook, he said, and when i did i saw his point. his class had got up to the eighteenforties. what i expected was a big beefing up of the roles of sacagawea and crispus attucks, and, indeed, there was some of that. but the main difference between my son's text and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in american history. there were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and reciprocal trade agreements. i skipped ahead, past the civil war, hoping for easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation of freight rates. only a few decades into the twentieth century did it become possible to see the federal government's main function as responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice, instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic interests. even now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in washington, what you'd find is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so much over the public as over each other agribusiness versus real estate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. the arena in which this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. it's an insider's game, less because the players are secretive than because the public and the pressencouraged by the players, who speak in jargon can't get themselves interested. one corner of washington might be called f.c.c. world, for the federal communications commission. f.c.c. world has perhaps five thousand denizens. they work at the commission itself, at the house and senate commerce committees, and at the washington offices of the companies that the commission regulates. they read communications daily (subscription price $3,695 a year), and every year around christmastime they grumblingly attend the chairman's dinner, at a washington hotel, where the high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly selfdeprecating comedy routine by the commission's chairman. of all the federal agencies and commissions, the f.c.c. is the one that americans ought to be most interested in after all, it is involved with a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the american economy, as well as important aspects of daily lifetelephone and television and radio and newspapers and the internet. and right now f.c.c. world is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather, because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the ""corporate scandals"" concerns the economic collapse of companies regulated by the f.c.c. qwest, worldcom, adelphia, and global crossing, among others, are (or were) part of f.c.c. world. aol time warner is part of f.c.c. world. jack grubman, the former salomon smith barney analyst who seems to have succeeded kenneth lay, of enron, as the embodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of f.c.c. world. in the past two years, companies belonging to f.c.c. world have lost trillions of dollars in stockmarket valuation, and have collectively served as a dead weight pulling down the entire stock market. this year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state of the f.c.c. has been circulating widely within f.c.c. world. it evokes f.c.c. world's feverish mood (""the f.c.c. is fiddling while rome burns"") and suggests why nobody besides residents of f.c.c. world has thought of the commission in connection with the corporate scandals. the sentence i just quoted is followed by this explanation ""the ilecs appear likely to enter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no residential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10% market share loss in business lines to clecs."" it's a lot easier to think about evil c.e.o.s than to decipher that. even in good times, f.c.c. world pays obsessive attention to the commission's chairman. in bad times, the attention becomes especially intense and when the chairman is a celebrity f.c.c. world devotes itself to fulltime chairmanwatching. the current chairman, michael powell, is a celebrity, at least by governmentofficial standards, because he is the only son of colin powell, the secretary of state. unlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which generates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about who he really is and what he's really up to. powell is young to be the head of a federal agencyhe is thirtynineand genially charming. everybody likes him. before becoming chairman, he was for three years one of the f.c.c.'s five commissioners not only is he fluent in the f.c.c.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a clintonesque love of the arcane details of communications policy. he's always saying that he's an ""avid moderate."" and yet he has a rageinciting quality. one of his predecessors as chairman, reed hundt, quoted in forbes, compared powell to herbert hoover. mark cooper, of the consumer federation of america, calls him ""radical and extreme."" just as often as he's accused of being a rightwing ideologue, powell gets accused of being paralytically cautious. ""it ain't about singing 'kumbayah' around the campfire,"" another former chairman, william kennard, says. ""you have to have an answer."" one day last spring, powell, testifying before a senate subcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the subcommittee's chairman, ernest hollings, of south carolina, berated him. ""you don't care about these regulations,"" hollings said. ""you don't care about the law or what congress sets down. . . . that's the fundamental. that's the misgiving i have of your administration over there. it just is amazing to me. you just pellmell down the road and seem to not care at all. i think you'd be a wonderful executive vicepresident of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a regulatory commission at the government level. are you happy in your job?"" ""extremely,"" powell said, with an amiable smile. one cannot understand powell's maddening effect, at least on democrats and liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. the f.c.c. was created by congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the new deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy cases for government intervention in the private economy making sure that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. its other original function was preventing american telephone  telegraph, the national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers unfairly. over the decades, as f.c.c. world grew up into a comfortable, wellestablished place, the f.c.c. segued into the role of industrial supervisionits real purpose. it was supposed to manage the competition among communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business. in addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission more specifically protected the interests of members of congress, many of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most terrifying category of interest groupyou can cross the local bank president and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster. according to an ofttold f.c.c. world anecdote, president clinton once blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers in the same city because, he said, if the soandso who owned the anticlinton little rock democratgazette had owned the leading tv station in little rock, too, clinton would never have become president. f.c.c. world may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too, because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic niches for themselves. then, in the nineteeneighties, the successful breakup of a.t.  t.by far the biggest and most important company the commission regulateddeposited a thick additional sediment of selfconfidence onto the consciousness of f.c.c. world. a generation ago, for most americans, there was one local phone company, one longdistance company, and one company that manufactured telephones, which customers were not permitted to ownand they were all the same company. it was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. by the midnineteennineties, there were a dozen economically viable local phone companies, a handful of national longdistance companies competing to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturersand millions of americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the telephone lines. a.t.  t. had argued for years that it was a ""natural monopoly,"" requiring protection from economic competition and total control over its lines. so much for that argument. over the same period, the f.c.c. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones and the internet. it was the dream of federalagency success come true consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more prosperous, too. the next big step was supposed to be the telecommunications act of 1996, one of those massive, endlessly lobbiedover pieces of legislation which most people outside f.c.c. world probably felt it was safe to ignore. although the telecom act sailed under the rhetorical banner of modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interestgroup bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers as ""baby bells"" and to f.c.c. world as ""arbocks"" (the pronounced version of rbocs, or regional bell operating companies), would be permitted to offer longdistance service in exchange for letting the longdistance companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for customers. consumers would win, because for the first time they would get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more competition than they already had in long distance. but the politics and economics of the telecom act (which was shepherded through congress by vicepresident gore) were just as important. democrats saw the act as helping to reposition them as the technology partythe party that brought the internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. clinton's slogans about the ""information superhighway"" and ""building a bridge to the twentyfirst century,"" which, like all clinton slogans, artfully sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical correlates of the telecom act, and gore's cruise to the presidency was supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success. the f.c.c. had a crucial role in all this. the arbocks are rich, aggressive, politically powerful, and generally republican (though like all important interest groups they work with both parties) they immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. through rulemaking, enforcement, and litigation, the f.c.c., then headed by reed hundt, who was gore's classmate at st. albans, was supposed to keep the arbocks in their cages, so that not only longdistance companies like a.t.  t. and mci worldcom but also a whole category of new companies, ""seelecks"" (the pronounced version of clecs, or competitive local exchange carriers), could emerge. this entailed the regulatory equivalent of handtohand combat the seeleck is supposed to have access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the seeleck asks the f.c.c. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key. partly because hundt assured the seelecks and other new companies that he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the seeleckscompanies with names like winstar, covad, and teligentand into other telecommunications companies. even not obviously related technology companies like cisco systems benefitted from the telecom boom demand for their products was supposed to come from the seelecks and other new players. there would be no conflict between the interests of the new telecom companies and those of consumers as one of hundt's former lieutenants told me, ""reed used to joke that my job was to make sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up."" the years following the passage of the telecom act were the peak of the boom. wall street had its blood up, and that meant not just more startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies time warner and aol decided to throw in together, and a.t.  t. and comcast, and so on. (surely, worldcom and the other telecom bad guys believed that their selfdealing, stockoverselling, and creative accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating.) by the time the outcome of the 2000 presidential election had been determined, the telecom crash was well under way. nonetheless, the chairmanship of the f.c.c. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator. three republicans emerged as candidates powell, who was a commissioner harold furchtgottroth, the farthesttotheright commissioner and patrick wood, the head of the texas public utility commission and, as such, a george w. bush guy. in texas, however, wood had crossed the most powerful person in the arbock camp, edward whitacre, the c.e.o. of s.b.c. communications, which is headquartered in san antonio. this meant that the arbocks didn't want wood as head of the f.c.c., because he might be too proseeleck. (wood is now the head of the federal energy regulatory commission.) michael powell had to signal the arbocks that he wasn't as threatening as wood, while also signalling the conservative movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than furchtgottroth. powell did this deftly. for example, in december of 2000 he appeared before a conservative group called the progress  freedom foundation and gave a very michael powell speechwhimsical, intellectual, and freeassociative (biblical history, joseph schumpeter, moore's law)that began by making fun of the idea that the f.c.c. should try to keep new telecom companies alive. ""in the wake of the 1996 act, the f.c.c. is often cast as the grinch who stole christmas,"" powell said. ""like the whos, down in whoville, who feast on whopudding and rare whoroast beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the act's fertile soil. but this feast the f.c.c. grinch did not like in the least, so it is thought."" thus powell was indicating that if he became chairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the seelecks as part of the job. he was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day of the bush administration. twenty months into the administration, nearly all the seelecks are dead or dying nearly all longdistance companies, not just worldcom, are in serious trouble cable companies have lost half their value satellite companies are staggering. the crash has had an automatically concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing companies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged companies at bargain prices. during the bush administration, as the financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. if the bells wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national duopoly in local service verizon, in the east, and s.b.c., in the west. and these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the poor health of the longdistance companies. the cable business also seems close to having two dominant national companies, aol time warner and comcast. unlike the phone companies, they don't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more fully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. as part of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996 telecom act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of radiostation owners in the united states has been cut by twentyfive per cent today, a large portion of local and national radio news programming is supplied by a single company, westwood one, a subsidiary of viacom. in this situation, many democrats and liberals think, the f.c.c. should be hyperactivethe superhero of government regulation, springing to the rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. it should try to breathe life into the seelecks and other new companies. it should disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the forces of concentration. it should use the government's money and muscle to get new technologyespecially fast internet connectionsinto the homes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (an analogy that a lot of people in f.c.c. world make is between telecom and the middle east the clinton people blame the bloodshed on the bush people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the bush people blame it on the clinton people, because they raised too many expectations and stirred too many passions.) but michael powell's f.c.c. has not been hyperactive. powell has been conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the f.c.c. and waiting for the federal courts and the congress to send him signals. (in midseptember, powell finally initiated a formal review of the f.c.c.'s limits on media concentration.) this doesn't mean he has been inactive rather, he has been active in a way that further infuriates his criticsin a manner that smoothly blends the genial and the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of f.c.c. world really make sense, while giving the impression that he's having the time of his life as chairman. at his first press conference, when he was asked what he was going to do about the ""digital divide""that is, economic inequality in access to the internethe said, ""you know, i think there is a mercedes divide. i'd like to have one and i can't afford one."" at the national cable  telecommunications association convention, in chicago, powell, following a troupe of tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a somersault. not long ago, i went to see powell in his office at the f.c.c. until 1998, when the commission moved to a new building in southwest washington, near the city's openair fish market, f.c.c. world was at the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. today, the f.c.c. building looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park. even the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and fluorescent. powell is a bulky man who wears goldrimmed glasses and walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a jeep accident in germany, in 1987, when he was an army officer. because of the accident, he left the army and went to law school, where he became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of the market before the fact""prophylactically,"" as he likes to sayshould wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust litigation to fix them. he worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and then became a protg of joel klein, the head of the antitrust division of the clinton justice department and the man who led the government's legal case against microsoft. (he was recently appointed chancellor of the new york publicschool system.) it testifies to powell's political skill that he is probably the only high official in the bush administration who not only served in the clinton administration but also maintains close ties to bush's nemesis senator john mccain, of arizona. one of the things about powell that annoy people is his enduring love of law school""it's sort of like a lawschool study session over there,"" one democratic former commissioner said. as if to confirm the charge, powell, when i arrived, introduced me to four law students, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in. i began by asking powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions of the f.c.c. for example, could private companies have apportioned the airwaves among themselves without the government being involved? ""i think we'll never know,"" powell said. ""i don't think it's an automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. land is probably the best analogue. we don't seize all the land in the united states and say, 'the government will issue licenses to use land.' if my neighbor puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law about what i can do about that, including whether i can tear it down. if a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a similar proposition. there are scholars who argueindeed, the famous ronald coase treatise that won the nobel prize was about thisthat spectrum policy is lunacy. the market could work this out, in the kinds of ways that we're accustomed to."" talking to powell was fun. unlike most high government officials, he doesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. he slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. he speaks in ironic air quotes. he's like your libertarian friend in college who enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he sees as sentimental or illogical. after a while, i asked him whether he thought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 telecommunications act had been excessive. ""i would start with a caveat,"" powell said. ""look, i can't fault those judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought. they were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities. but, frankly, i've always been a little bit critical. first of all, anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn't come anywhere close to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the president on down, about the kinds of things it's going to open up. i mean, i don't know what provisions are the informationsuperhighway provisions, or what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that were a big part of the theatre of its introduction. when one starts reading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions. but, nonetheless, there was a rising dotcom excitement, and an internet excitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it certainly was. ""but. we were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of expectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the economy or the market even gets in trouble. it was a dramatically exaggerated expectationby the leadership of the commission, by politicians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. it was a gold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones that government encouraged by its policies, frankly. everybody wanted to see numbers go up on the board."" powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the telecom act. "" 'i want to see ten competitors. twenty competitors! i want to see thirtypercent market share. fiftypercent market share! i want the bells to bleed! then we'll know we've succeeded.' "" now powell returned to being powell. ""i think that expectation was astonishingly unrealistic, in the short term. they wanted to see it while they're there. we were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. and the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. there's no question, we went too soon too fast. too many companies took on too much debt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business model."" how could the telecom act have been handled better? ""we could have chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system,"" powell said. ""money chased what seemed like governmentpromised opportunity. the problem with that is there's a morning after, and we're in it. and the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. this debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. in some ways, for shortterm gain, we paid a price in longterm stability."" powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there had been a more ""reasonable"" level of investment. ""no, we wouldn't have every home in america with competitive choice yetbut we don't anyway. i don't think it's the remonopolization of telephone service. i don't buy that. the bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn't? the part of the story that didn't materialize was that people thought so would mci worldcom and sprint."" other local phone companies, he added, hadn't materialized as viable businesses, either, and they never might. ""everybody's always saying, 'the regulators did this and this and this.' but, candidly, the story's quite the opposite. i think the regulators bent over backward for six years to give them a chance. conditions don't get that good except once every thirty years, and it didn't happen. so, whatever the reason, we're looking at a worldcom that's teetering. we're looking at a longdistance business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. a.t.  t. is breaking itself up. sprint has struggled."" could the f.c.c. have done anything to make the longdistance companies stronger? ""at the f.c.c.? i think i'll just be blunt. my political answer? yes, there's all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try to help. but i can't find thirty billion dollars for worldcom somewhere. i can't mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an s.e.c. investigation. were i king, it would be wonderful, but i don't have those kinds of levers. i don't know whether anybody does. at some point, companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from dying."" powell couldn't have made it much clearer that he doesn't think it's his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. he has demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist gesturesin august, for example, five months after disbanding the f.c.c.'s accounting safeguards division, powell announced that he was appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the communications industry. but that shows that powell is better at riding out the storm than, say, harvey pitt, his counterpart at the securities and exchange commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore up the telecom industry. i asked powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one company provided cable television and only one provided local phone service. ""yes,"" he said. ""it concerns us that there's one of each of those things, but let's not diminish the importance of there being one of each of those things. that still is a nice suite of communications capabilities, even if they aren't direct analogues of each other."" anyway, powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to provide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will provide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice. ""so, yeah, we have this anxiety we have one of everything. the question is, does it stay that way?"" the concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of information did not appear to trouble powell, either. he said that people confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration, which distorts markets. ""if this were just economics, it's easy. if you were to say to me, 'mike, just worry about economic concentration,' we know how to do thatthe econometrics of antitrust. i can tell you when a market's too concentrated and prices are going to rise. the problem is other dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. take the question of, if everybody's controlling what you see, the assumption there is that somehow there'll be this viewpoint, a monolithic viewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won't get diversity. i think that's a possibility. i don't think it's nearly the possibility that's ascribed to it sometimes."" powell explained, ""sometimes when we see very pointed political or parochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. i see some of the same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when rush limbaugh exists. they love diversity, but somehow we should run howard stern off the planet. if it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias, and then we have policies like""here his tone went from ironic to sarcastic""the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis of what i thought those people cared about. so when somebody is pointed and opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic fairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out."" f.c.c. world abounds in theories about michael powell. one is that he can't make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries he regulatesso he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the market, in order to buy himself time. another is that he's carrying water for the arbocks and the big cable companies. another is that he is planning to run for the senate from virginia (or to be appointed attorney general in a second bush term), and doesn't want to do anything at the f.c.c. that would diminish his chances. another is that he's waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action, so that he doesn't wind up going first and getting caught in the crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television networks. (in f.c.c. world, this is known as the powell doctrine of telecom, after colin powell's idea that the united states should never commit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force, and an exit strategy.) and another is that he actually believes what he says, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and irreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.

( imo we have to fix  the highscorers anyway  no spam ever needs to score over 5 in our  scoring system, 5  tagged anyway. this is off the topic of the rest of this discussion, but amavisd (in all its incarnations) and mimedefang and several other mta plugins all reject at smtp time messages that scores higher than some threshold (often 10). if some new release were to start scoring all spam no higher than 5.1, there'd better be zero fps, because all those filters would drop their thresholds to 5. on thu, 29 aug 2002, michael moncur wrote  but i agree that there needs to be more focus on eliminating rules that  frequently hit on newsletters. if any newsletters actually use the habeas  mark, that will be one way to help. newsletters won't use the mark. habeas is priced way too high  a factor of at least 20 over what the market will bear, imo  on a permessage basis for most typical mailing lists (lockergnome, say) to afford it. on thu, 29 aug 2002, harold hallikainen wrote  habeus has come up with a very clever way to use existing law to battle  spam. it seems that at some point they could drop the licensing fee to  $1 or less and make all their income off suing the spammers for  copyright infringement. sorry, that just can't work. if the habeas mark actually becomes both widespread enough in nonspam, and effectivelyenforced enough to be absent from spam, such that, e.g., sa could assign a positive score to messages that do not have it, then spammers are out of business and habeas has no one to sue. there's nobody left to charge except the people who want (or are forced against their will because their mail won't get through otherwise) to use the mark. conversely, if there are enough spammers forging the mark for habeas to make all its income suing them, then the mark is useless for the purpose for which it was designed. either way it seems to me that, after maybe a couple of lawsuits against real spammers and a lot of ceaseanddesist letters to clueless mompops, then either (a) they're out of business, (b) they have to sell the rights to use the mark to increasingly questionable senders, or (c) they've both created and monopolized a market for ""internet postage stamps"" that everybody has to pay them for. the latter would be quite a coup if they  could pull it off  they do absolutely nothing useful, unless you consider threatening people with lawsuits useful, yet still collect a fee either directly or indirectly from everyone on the internet  effectively we'll be paying them for the privilege of policing their trademark for them. i don't believe they'll ever get that far, but i don't particularly want to help them make it.  and i use the term ""they"" loosely, because the whole company could consist of one lawyer if it really got to that point.  this sf.net email is sponsored bythinkgeek welcome to geek heaven.  spamassassintalk mailing list",[],4601,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""with these sort of things you have to find some process that would accept a connection, then throw loads of random data at it and get it to crash,"" he said. ""once it's crashed, you can try to find a way to exploit it."" he said the proofofconcept that was published is designed to run on notepad, but could be easily modified to run any program on the system. he said the problem was easy to fix by ""writing protective code around that particular piece to more closely validate the data around that piece."" ""because people are pushed for productivity you tend to leave out the checks and balances you should put in, which is why we have all these buffer overflows and exploits out there now,"" said banes. cerulean studios, creator of trillian, was contacted for comment but had not responded by the time of publication.  for all securityrelated news, including updates on the latest viruses, hacking exploits and patches, check out zdnet uk's security news section. have your say instantly, and see what others have said. go to the security forum. let the editors know what you think in the mailroom. copyright  2002 cnet networks, inc. all rights reserved. zdnet is a registered service mark of cnet networks, inc. zdnet logo is a service mark of cnet networks, inc.",[],2672,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""freedom of expression! freedom of expression!"" they and other  houellebecq supporters chanted after they were thrown out of the  courtroom at the main law courts in central paris.   while intellectuals argued before the trial that houellebecq should  be free to write what he wants, lyon mosque rector kamel kabtan  retorted ""we are for freedom of expression, but not for insulting  communities.""   bete noire   houellebecq, 45, the bete noire of contemporary french literature,  is no stranger to controversy. he offended conservatives and the  politically correct left with his 1998 novel ""les particules  elementaires"" (""atomised"" in english).   paris mosque rector dalil boubakeur says muslims have been insulted  once before by houellebecq, who had the main character in plateforme  admit he felt ""a quiver of glee"" every time a ""palestinian  terrorist"" was killed.   the world islamic league, the lyon mosque and the national  federation of muslims in france have joined the paris mosque in  bringing houellebecq to trial.   france's human rights league joined them as a civil party, saying  houellebecq's comments amounted to ""islamophobia"" and deserved to be  sanctioned as part of the league's struggle against discrimination  and racism.   the paris mosque has hired jeanmarc varaut, one of france's leading  trial lawyers, whose past clients include maurice papon, the former  official condemned in 1998 for naziera crimes against humanity for  sending jews to death camps.   restoring blasphemy?   houellebecq's lawyer emmanuel pierrat argues that the case  effectively reestablishes the notion of blasphemy, despite the fact  that france as a secular state has no such law, and says  houellebecq's opponents want to deny him freedom of expression.   he also argues that the interview in lire truncated a sixhour  conversation and houellebecq was not given the chance to approve the  article before it appeared.   houellebecq's publisher flammarion has distanced itself from the  author, whose comments some say may have cost him france's  prestigious goncourt prize  for which he had been a contender.   the novelist, who lives outside cork, ireland, writes in a detached  style about a bleak world in which people have forgotten how to  love.   translated into 25 languages, ""atomised"" incensed france's 1968  generation with its scathing descriptions of the hippie era but won  him france's november prize in 1998 and the impac award, one of the  world's biggest fiction prizes.   losing his case may mean a year in jail or a $51,000 fine.  gordon",[],4354,0,0,easy_ham_testing

the beginning of his reign at the fcc. he said they were going to take a real hands off approach, so it's funny that they would blame the regulators for causing the collapse. one thing he did get right, is that he wasn't worried that the us was behind europe in the wireless licensing spectrum. this is something very prescient in that most of those licensors have had to eat their lunch over the huge licensing costs they paid for very little benefit. his legacy wasis supposed to be rethinking the fcc's role to stay out of the way in this period of business innovation in the wireless space as he didn't want the government forcing business models onto the private sector. his full transcript is here 1. interestingly enough i got to see his speech in person as he was part of the whole ctia'2001 las vegas keynote series of speakers. clay and i hoped a flight out of ontario to las vegas to do demo support for craig barrett 2. his message was that there's no difference between wired and wireless internetit's all the same thing. instead of scalable networks, we should be thinking about scalable content ( using magi he showed sending a blue man tv commercial from a desktop to a laptop to an ipaq to a color smartphone with the content scaling back for each target platform). the best part of the whole trip wasn't hobnobbing at all, but really the fact that the venetian had ran out of rooms. they decided to put us up in one of their $10,000night high roller rooms. they put clay in one and me in another. the venetian is known for having the largest hotel rooms anywhere, but these ones were bigger than my whole house. 8) greg 1 2 rohit khare wrote  i can't believe i actually read a laughoutloud funny profile of the  fcc commissioner fer crissakes! so the following article comes  recommended, a fine explanation of michael powell's extraordinary  equivocation.   on the other hand, i can also agree with werbach's werblog entry... rohit   a trip to f.c.c. world   nicholas lemann has a piece in the new yorker this week about fcc  chairman michael powell. it's one of the first articles i've seen  that captures some of powell's real personality, and the way he's  viewed in washington. unfortunately, lemann ends by endorsing  conventional political wisdom. after describing how powell isn't  really a firebreathing ideological conservative, he concludes that,  in essence, powell favors the inumbent local bell telephone companies,  while a democratic fcc would favor new entrants. i know that's not  how powell sees the world, and though i disagree with him on many  issues, i think he's right to resist the old dichotomy.   the telecom collapse should be a humbling experience for anyone who  went through it. the disaster wasn't the regulators' fault, as some  conservatives argue. but something clearly went horribly wrong, and  policymakers should learn from that experience. contrary to lemann's  speculation, the upstart carriers won't be successful in a gore  administration, because it's too late. virtually all of them are  dead, and wall street has turned off the capital tap for the  foreseeable future. some may survive, but as small players rather  than worlddominators.   the battle between clecs and rbocs that lemann so astutely parodies is  old news. the next important battle in telecom will be between those  who want to stay within the traditional boxes, and those who use  different models entirely. that's why open broadband networks and  open spectrum are so important. whatever the regulatory environment,  there is going to be consolidation in telecom. those left out in that  consolidation will face increasing pressure to create new pipes into  the home, or slowly die. the victors in the consolidation game will  cut back on innovation and raise prices, which will create further  pressure for alternatives.   lemann is right that policymaking looks much drier and more ambiguous  on the ground than through the lens of history. but he's wrong in  thinking that telecom's future will be something like its past.   friday, october 04, 2002  111711 am comments 0        the chairman  by nicholas lemann  he's the other powell, and no one is sure what he's up to.  new yorker, october 8, 2002   last year, my middle son, in eighth grade and encountering his first  fairly serious americanhistory course, indignantly reported that the  whole subject was incomprehensible. i was shocked. what about gettysburg  and the declaration of independence and the selmatomontgomery march?  just look at my textbook, he said, and when i did i saw his point. his  class had got up to the eighteenforties. what i expected was a big  beefing up of the roles of sacagawea and crispus attucks, and, indeed,  there was some of that. but the main difference between my son's text  and that of my own childhood was that somebody had made the disastrous  decision to devote most of it to what had actually happened in american  history. there were pages and pages on tariffs and bank charters and  reciprocal trade agreements. i skipped ahead, past the civil war, hoping  for easier going, only to encounter currency floats and the regulation  of freight rates. only a few decades into the twentieth century did it  become possible to see the federal government's main function as  responding to dramatic crises and launching crusades for social justice,  instead of attempting to referee competing claims from economic interests.   even now, if one were to reveal what really goes on behind the pretty  speeches and the sanctimonious hearings in washington, what you'd find  is thousands of lawyers and lobbyists madly vying for advantage, not so  much over the public as over each other agribusiness versus real  estate, banks versus insurance companies, and so on. the arena in which  this competition mainly takes place is regulatory agencies and  commissions and the congressional committees that supervise them. it's  an insider's game, less because the players are secretive than because  the public and the pressencouraged by the players, who speak in jargon  can't get themselves interested.   one corner of washington might be called f.c.c. world, for the federal  communications commission. f.c.c. world has perhaps five thousand  denizens. they work at the commission itself, at the house and senate  commerce committees, and at the washington offices of the companies that  the commission regulates. they read communications daily (subscription  price $3,695 a year), and every year around christmastime they  grumblingly attend the chairman's dinner, at a washington hotel, where  the high point of the evening is a scripted, supposedly selfdeprecating  comedy routine by the commission's chairman.   of all the federal agencies and commissions, the f.c.c. is the one that  americans ought to be most interested in after all, it is involved with  a business sector that accounts for about fifteen per cent of the  american economy, as well as important aspects of daily lifetelephone  and television and radio and newspapers and the internet. and right now  f.c.c. world is in, if not a crisis, at least a very soapy lather,  because a good portion of what the angry public thinks of as the  ""corporate scandals"" concerns the economic collapse of companies  regulated by the f.c.c. qwest, worldcom, adelphia, and global crossing,  among others, are (or were) part of f.c.c. world. aol time warner is  part of f.c.c. world. jack grubman, the former salomon smith barney  analyst who seems to have succeeded kenneth lay, of enron, as the  embodiment of the corporate scandals, is part of f.c.c. world. in the  past two years, companies belonging to f.c.c. world have lost trillions  of dollars in stockmarket valuation, and have collectively served as a  dead weight pulling down the entire stock market.   this year, an alarmed and acerbic anonymous memorandum about the state  of the f.c.c. has been circulating widely within f.c.c. world. it evokes  f.c.c. world's feverish mood (""the f.c.c. is fiddling while rome burns"")  and suggests why nobody besides residents of f.c.c. world has thought of  the commission in connection with the corporate scandals. the sentence i  just quoted is followed by this explanation ""the ilecs appear likely to  enter all l.d. markets within twelve months, while losing virtually no  residential customers to attackers since 1996, and suffering about 10%  market share loss in business lines to clecs."" it's a lot easier to  think about evil c.e.o.s than to decipher that.    even in good times, f.c.c. world pays obsessive attention to the  commission's chairman. in bad times, the attention becomes especially  intense and when the chairman is a celebrity f.c.c. world devotes  itself to fulltime chairmanwatching. the current chairman, michael  powell, is a celebrity, at least by governmentofficial standards,  because he is the only son of colin powell, the secretary of state.  unlike his father, he has a kind of mesmerizing ambiguity, which  generates enormous, and at times apoplectically toned, speculation about  who he really is and what he's really up to. powell is young to be the  head of a federal agencyhe is thirtynineand genially charming.  everybody likes him. before becoming chairman, he was for three years  one of the f.c.c.'s five commissioners not only is he fluent in the  f.c.c.'s incomprehensible patois, he has a clintonesque love of the  arcane details of communications policy. he's always saying that he's an  ""avid moderate."" and yet he has a rageinciting quality. one of his  predecessors as chairman, reed hundt, quoted in forbes, compared powell  to herbert hoover. mark cooper, of the consumer federation of america,  calls him ""radical and extreme."" just as often as he's accused of being  a rightwing ideologue, powell gets accused of being paralytically  cautious. ""it ain't about singing 'kumbayah' around the campfire,""  another former chairman, william kennard, says. ""you have to have an  answer."" one day last spring, powell, testifying before a senate  subcommittee, delivered an anodyne opening statement, and the  subcommittee's chairman, ernest hollings, of south carolina, berated  him. ""you don't care about these regulations,"" hollings said. ""you don't  care about the law or what congress sets down. . . . that's the  fundamental. that's the misgiving i have of your administration over  there. it just is amazing to me. you just pellmell down the road and  seem to not care at all. i think you'd be a wonderful executive  vicepresident of a chamber of commerce, but not a chairman of a  regulatory commission at the government level. are you happy in your job?""   ""extremely,"" powell said, with an amiable smile.    one cannot understand powell's maddening effect, at least on democrats  and liberal activists, without understanding not just the stated purpose  of the commission he chairs but also its real purpose. the f.c.c. was  created by congress in 1934, but it existed in prototype well before the  new deal, because it performs a function that is one of the classic easy  cases for government intervention in the private economy making sure  that broadcasters stick to their assigned spots on the airwaves. its  other original function was preventing american telephone  telegraph,  the national monopoly phone company, from treating its customers  unfairly. over the decades, as f.c.c. world grew up into a comfortable,  wellestablished place, the f.c.c. segued into the role of industrial  supervisionits real purpose. it was supposed to manage the competition  among communications companies so that it didn't become too bloody, by  artfully deciding who would be allowed to enter what line of business.  in addition to looking out for the public's interest, the commission  more specifically protected the interests of members of congress, many  of whom regard the media companies in their districts as the single most  terrifying category of interest groupyou can cross the local bank  president and live to tell the tale, but not the local broadcaster.  according to an ofttold f.c.c. world anecdote, president clinton once  blocked an attempt to allow television stations to buy daily newspapers  in the same city because, he said, if the soandso who owned the  anticlinton little rock democratgazette had owned the leading tv  station in little rock, too, clinton would never have become president.    f.c.c. world may have been con tentious, but it was settled, too,  because all the reasonably powerful players had created secure economic  niches for themselves. then, in the nineteeneighties, the successful  breakup of a.t.  t.by far the biggest and most important company the  commission regulateddeposited a thick additional sediment of  selfconfidence onto the consciousness of f.c.c. world. a generation  ago, for most americans, there was one local phone company, one  longdistance company, and one company that manufactured telephones,  which customers were not permitted to ownand they were all the same  company. it was illegal to plug any device into a phone line. by the  midnineteennineties, there were a dozen economically viable local  phone companies, a handful of national longdistance companies competing  to offer customers the lowest price and best service, and stores  everywhere selling telephone equipment from many manufacturersand  millions of americans had a fax machine and a modem operating over the  telephone lines. a.t.  t. had argued for years that it was a ""natural  monopoly,"" requiring protection from economic competition and total  control over its lines. so much for that argument. over the same period,  the f.c.c. had assisted in the birth of cable television and cell phones  and the internet. it was the dream of federalagency success come true  consumers vastly better served, and the industry much bigger and more  prosperous, too.   the next big step was supposed to be the telecommunications act of 1996,  one of those massive, endlessly lobbiedover pieces of legislation which  most people outside f.c.c. world probably felt it was safe to ignore.  although the telecom act sailed under the rhetorical banner of  modernization and deregulation, its essence was a grand interestgroup  bargain, in which the local phone companies, known to headline writers  as ""baby bells"" and to f.c.c. world as ""arbocks"" (the pronounced version  of rbocs, or regional bell operating companies), would be permitted to  offer longdistance service in exchange for letting the longdistance  companies and smaller new phone companies use their lines to compete for  customers. consumers would win, because for the first time they would  get the benefits of competition in local service while getting even more  competition than they already had in long distance. but the politics and  economics of the telecom act (which was shepherded through congress by  vicepresident gore) were just as important. democrats saw the act as  helping to reposition them as the technology partythe party that  brought the internet into every home, created hundreds of thousands of  jobs in new companies, and, not least, set off an investment boom whose  beneficiaries might become the party's new contributor base. clinton's  slogans about the ""information superhighway"" and ""building a bridge to  the twentyfirst century,"" which, like all clinton slogans, artfully  sent different messages to different constituencies, were the rhetorical  correlates of the telecom act, and gore's cruise to the presidency was  supposed to be powered substantially by the act's success.   the f.c.c. had a crucial role in all this. the arbocks are rich,  aggressive, politically powerful, and generally republican (though like  all important interest groups they work with both parties) they  immediately filed lawsuits, which wound up tying the hands of their new  competitors in the local phone market for more than three years. through  rulemaking, enforcement, and litigation, the f.c.c., then headed by  reed hundt, who was gore's classmate at st. albans, was supposed to keep  the arbocks in their cages, so that not only longdistance companies  like a.t.  t. and mci worldcom but also a whole category of new  companies, ""seelecks"" (the pronounced version of clecs, or competitive  local exchange carriers), could emerge. this entailed the regulatory  equivalent of handtohand combat the seeleck is supposed to have  access to the arbock's switching equipment, the arbock won't give the  seeleck a key to the room where it's kept, so the seeleck asks the  f.c.c. to rule that the arbock has to give it the key.   partly because hundt assured the seelecks and other new companies that  he would protect them, and partly because of the generally booming  condition of the economy then, investment capital flooded into the  seeleckscompanies with names like winstar, covad, and teligentand  into other telecommunications companies. even not obviously related  technology companies like cisco systems benefitted from the telecom  boom demand for their products was supposed to come from the seelecks  and other new players. there would be no conflict between the interests  of the new telecom companies and those of consumers as one of hundt's  former lieutenants told me, ""reed used to joke that my job was to make  sure that all prices went down and all stocks went up.""    the years following the passage of the telecom act were the peak of the  boom. wall street had its blood up, and that meant not just more  startups but also more mergers of existing communications companies  time warner and aol decided to throw in together, and a.t.  t. and  comcast, and so on. (surely, worldcom and the other telecom bad guys  believed that their selfdealing, stockoverselling, and creative  accounting would go unnoticed because the market was so undiscriminating.)   by the time the outcome of the 2000 presidential election had been  determined, the telecom crash was well under way. nonetheless, the  chairmanship of the f.c.c. remained one of the best jobs, in terms of  influence and visibility, available to a career government regulator.  three republicans emerged as candidates powell, who was a commissioner  harold furchtgottroth, the farthesttotheright commissioner and  patrick wood, the head of the texas public utility commission and, as  such, a george w. bush guy. in texas, however, wood had crossed the most  powerful person in the arbock camp, edward whitacre, the c.e.o. of  s.b.c. communications, which is headquartered in san antonio. this meant  that the arbocks didn't want wood as head of the f.c.c., because he  might be too proseeleck. (wood is now the head of the federal energy  regulatory commission.) michael powell had to signal the arbocks that he  wasn't as threatening as wood, while also signalling the conservative  movement that he was only negligibly farther to the left than  furchtgottroth.   powell did this deftly. for example, in december of 2000 he appeared  before a conservative group called the progress  freedom foundation and  gave a very michael powell speechwhimsical, intellectual, and  freeassociative (biblical history, joseph schumpeter, moore's law)that  began by making fun of the idea that the f.c.c. should try to keep new  telecom companies alive. ""in the wake of the 1996 act, the f.c.c. is  often cast as the grinch who stole christmas,"" powell said. ""like the  whos, down in whoville, who feast on whopudding and rare whoroast  beast, the communications industry was preparing to feast on the  deregulatory fruits it believed would inevitably sprout from the act's  fertile soil. but this feast the f.c.c. grinch did not like in the  least, so it is thought."" thus powell was indicating that if he became  chairman he didn't expect to administer first aid to the seelecks as  part of the job. he was appointed to the chairmanship on the first day  of the bush administration.   twenty months into the administration, nearly all the seelecks are dead  or dying nearly all longdistance companies, not just worldcom, are in  serious trouble cable companies have lost half their value satellite  companies are staggering. the crash has had an automatically  concentrating effect, because as new companies die the existing  companies' market share increases, and, if the existing companies are in  good shape financially, they have the opportunity to pick up damaged  companies at bargain prices. during the bush administration, as the  financial carnage in communications has worsened, the communications  industry has moved in the direction of more concentration. if the bells  wind up protecting their regional monopolies in local phone service, and  if they also merge, the country will be on its way to having a national  duopoly in local service verizon, in the east, and s.b.c., in the west.  and these companies could dominate long distance as well, because of the  poor health of the longdistance companies.   the cable business also seems close to having two dominant national  companies, aol time warner and comcast. unlike the phone companies, they  don't have to share their wiring with other companies and so can more  fully control what material they allow to enter people's homes. as part  of the complicated bargaining with interest groups that led to the 1996  telecom act, the limits on concentration in the radio industry were  significantly loosened, and in the past six years the number of  radiostation owners in the united states has been cut by twentyfive  per cent today, a large portion of local and national radio news  programming is supplied by a single company, westwood one, a subsidiary  of viacom.   in this situation, many democrats and liberals think, the f.c.c. should  be hyperactivethe superhero of government regulation, springing to the  rescue of both consumers and the communications industry. it should try  to breathe life into the seelecks and other new companies. it should  disallow mergers, maintain ownership limits, and otherwise restrain the  forces of concentration. it should use the government's money and muscle  to get new technologyespecially fast internet connectionsinto the  homes of people who can't afford it at current market prices. (an  analogy that a lot of people in f.c.c. world make is between telecom and  the middle east the clinton people blame the bloodshed on the bush  people, because they disengaged when they came into office, and the bush  people blame it on the clinton people, because they raised too many  expectations and stirred too many passions.)   but michael powell's f.c.c. has not been hyperactive. powell has been  conducting internal policy reviews and reforming the management of the  f.c.c. and waiting for the federal courts and the congress to send him  signals. (in midseptember, powell finally initiated a formal review of  the f.c.c.'s limits on media concentration.) this doesn't mean he has  been inactive rather, he has been active in a way that further  infuriates his criticsin a manner that smoothly blends the genial and  the provocative, he muses about whether the fundamental premises of  f.c.c. world really make sense, while giving the impression that he's  having the time of his life as chairman. at his first press conference,  when he was asked what he was going to do about the ""digital  divide""that is, economic inequality in access to the internethe said,  ""you know, i think there is a mercedes divide. i'd like to have one and  i can't afford one."" at the national cable  telecommunications  association convention, in chicago, powell, following a troupe of  tumblers to the stage, interrupted his walk to the podium to perform a  somersault.    not long ago, i went to see powell in his office at the f.c.c. until  1998, when the commission moved to a new building in southwest  washington, near the city's openair fish market, f.c.c. world was at  the western edge of downtown, where everybody would encounter everybody  else at a few familiar restaurants and bars. today, the f.c.c. building  looks like the office of a mortgage company in a suburban office park.  even the chairman's suite, though large, is beige, carpeted, and  fluorescent. powell is a bulky man who wears goldrimmed glasses and  walks with a pronounced limp, the result of injuries he suffered in a  jeep accident in germany, in 1987, when he was an army officer. because  of the accident, he left the army and went to law school, where he  became entranced with conservative ideas about regulation, particularly  the idea that the government, rather than trying to correct the flaws of  the market before the fact""prophylactically,"" as he likes to sayshould  wait till the flaws manifest themselves and then use antitrust  litigation to fix them. he worked briefly at a corporate law firm, and  then became a protg of joel klein, the head of the antitrust division  of the clinton justice department and the man who led the government's  legal case against microsoft. (he was recently appointed chancellor of  the new york publicschool system.) it testifies to powell's political  skill that he is probably the only high official in the bush  administration who not only served in the clinton administration but  also maintains close ties to bush's nemesis senator john mccain, of  arizona. one of the things about powell that annoy people is his  enduring love of law school""it's sort of like a lawschool study  session over there,"" one democratic former commissioner said. as if to  confirm the charge, powell, when i arrived, introduced me to four law  students, summer interns at the commission, whom he'd invited to sit in.   i began by asking powell whether he agreed with the founding assumptions  of the f.c.c. for example, could private companies have apportioned the  airwaves among themselves without the government being involved?   ""i think we'll never know,"" powell said. ""i don't think it's an  automatically bad idea, the way some people will argue. land is probably  the best analogue. we don't seize all the land in the united states and  say, 'the government will issue licenses to use land.' if my neighbor  puts a fence one foot onto my property line, there's a whole body of law  about what i can do about that, including whether i can tear it down. if  a wireless company was interfering with another wireless company, it's a  similar proposition. there are scholars who argueindeed, the famous  ronald coase treatise that won the nobel prize was about thisthat  spectrum policy is lunacy. the market could work this out, in the kinds  of ways that we're accustomed to.""   talking to powell was fun. unlike most high government officials, he  doesn't seem to be invested in appearing dignified or commanding. he  slumps in his chair and fiddles with his tie and riffs. he speaks in  ironic air quotes. he's like your libertarian friend in college who  enjoyed staying up all night asking impertinent rhetorical questions  about aspects of life that everybody else takes for granted but that he  sees as sentimental or illogical. after a while, i asked him whether he  thought his predecessors' excitement about the 1996 telecommunications  act had been excessive.   ""i would start with a caveat,"" powell said. ""look, i can't fault those  judgments in and of themselves, given the time and what people thought.  they were not the only ones who were hysterical about the opportunities.  but, frankly, i've always been a little bit critical. first of all,  anybody who works with the act knows that it doesn't come anywhere close  to matching the hyperbole that was associated with it, by the president  on down, about the kinds of things it's going to open up. i mean, i  don't know what provisions are the informationsuperhighway provisions,  or what provisions are so digitally oriented, or some of the things that  were a big part of the theatre of its introduction. when one starts  reading the details, one searches, often in vain, for these provisions.  but, nonetheless, there was a rising dotcom excitement, and an internet  excitement, and people thought this was historic legislation, and it  certainly was.   ""but. we were sucking helium out of balloons, with the kinds of  expectations that were being bandied around, and this is before the  economy or the market even gets in trouble. it was a dramatically  exaggerated expectationby the leadership of the commission, by  politicians, by the market itself, by companies themselves. it was a  gold rush, and led to some very detrimental business decisions, ones  that government encouraged by its policies, frankly. everybody wanted to  see numbers go up on the board.""   powell began imitating an imagined true believer in the telecom act. ""  'i want to see ten competitors. twenty competitors! i want to see  thirtypercent market share. fiftypercent market share! i want the  bells to bleed! then we'll know we've succeeded.' "" now powell returned  to being powell. ""i think that expectation was astonishingly  unrealistic, in the short term. they wanted to see it while they're  there. we were starting to get drunk on the juice we were drinking. and  the market was getting drunk on the juice we were drinking. there's no  question, we went too soon too fast. too many companies took on too much  debt too fast before the market really had a product, or a business model.""   how could the telecom act have been handled better? ""we could have  chosen policies that were less hellbent on a single objective, and were  slightly more balanced and put more economic discipline in the system,""  powell said. ""money chased what seemed like governmentpromised  opportunity. the problem with that is there's a morning after, and we're  in it. and the problem is there is no short fix for this problem. this  debt is going to take years to bring down to a realistic level. in some  ways, for shortterm gain, we paid a price in longterm stability.""   powell went on to say that it might have turned out differently if there  had been a more ""reasonable"" level of investment. ""no, we wouldn't have  every home in america with competitive choice yetbut we don't anyway. i  don't think it's the remonopolization of telephone service. i don't buy  that. the bells will prosper, but did anybody believe they wouldn't? the  part of the story that didn't materialize was that people thought so  would mci worldcom and sprint.""   other local phone companies, he added, hadn't materialized as viable  businesses, either, and they never might. ""everybody's always saying,  'the regulators did this and this and this.' but, candidly, the story's  quite the opposite. i think the regulators bent over backward for six  years to give them a chance. conditions don't get that good except once  every thirty years, and it didn't happen. so, whatever the reason, we're  looking at a worldcom that's teetering. we're looking at a longdistance  business that has had a rapid decline in its revenue base. a.t.  t. is  breaking itself up. sprint has struggled.""   could the f.c.c. have done anything to make the longdistance companies  stronger? ""at the f.c.c.? i think i'll just be blunt. my political  answer? yes, there's all kinds of things we can do at the margin to try  to help. but i can't find thirty billion dollars for worldcom somewhere.  i can't mitigate the impacts of an accounting scandal and an s.e.c.  investigation. were i king, it would be wonderful, but i don't have  those kinds of levers. i don't know whether anybody does. at some point,  companies are expected to run themselves in a way that keeps them from  dying."" powell couldn't have made it much clearer that he doesn't think  it's his responsibility to do anything about the telecom crash. he has  demonstrated his sure political touch by making accommodationist  gesturesin august, for example, five months after disbanding the  f.c.c.'s accounting safeguards division, powell announced that he was  appointing a committee to study accounting standards in the  communications industry. but that shows that powell is better at riding  out the storm than, say, harvey pitt, his counterpart at the securities  and exchange commission, and does not mean that he plans to try to shore  up the telecom industry.   i asked powell if it would bother him if, for most people, only one  company provided cable television and only one provided local phone  service. ""yes,"" he said. ""it concerns us that there's one of each of  those things, but let's not diminish the importance of there being one  of each of those things. that still is a nice suite of communications  capabilities, even if they aren't direct analogues of each other.""  anyway, powell said, before long the phone companies will be able to  provide video service over their lines, and the cable companies will  provide data service over their lines, so there will be more choice.  ""so, yeah, we have this anxiety we have one of everything. the question  is, does it stay that way?""   the concentration of ownership and the concentrated control of  information did not appear to trouble powell, either. he said that  people confuse bigness, which brings many benefits, with concentration,  which distorts markets. ""if this were just economics, it's easy. if you  were to say to me, 'mike, just worry about economic concentration,' we  know how to do thatthe econometrics of antitrust. i can tell you when a  market's too concentrated and prices are going to rise. the problem is  other dimensions, like political, ideological, sometimes emotional. take  the question of, if everybody's controlling what you see, the assumption  there is that somehow there'll be this viewpoint, a monolithic  viewpoint, pushed on you by your media and you won't get diversity. i  think that's a possibility. i don't think it's nearly the possibility  that's ascribed to it sometimes.""   powell explained, ""sometimes when we see very pointed political or  parochial programming, it gets attacked as unfair. i see some of the  same people who claim they want diversity go crazy when rush limbaugh  exists. they love diversity, but somehow we should run howard stern off  the planet. if it has a point of view, then it becomes accused of bias,  and then we have policies like""here his tone went from ironic to  sarcastic""the fairness doctrine, which seems to me like the antithesis  of what i thought those people cared about. so when somebody is pointed  and opinionated, we do all this stuff in the name of journalistic  fairness and integrity or whatever, to make them balance it out.""    f.c.c. world abounds in theories about michael powell. one is that he  can't make up his mind about how to address the crisis in the industries  he regulatesso he talks (and talks and talks) flamboyantly about the  market, in order to buy himself time. another is that he's carrying  water for the arbocks and the big cable companies. another is that he is  planning to run for the senate from virginia (or to be appointed  attorney general in a second bush term), and doesn't want to do anything  at the f.c.c. that would diminish his chances. another is that he's  waiting to move until there is more consensus on some course of action,  so that he doesn't wind up going first and getting caught in the  crossfire between the arbocks and the cable companies and the television  networks. (in f.c.c. world, this is known as the powell doctrine of  telecom, after colin powell's idea that the united states should never  commit itself militarily without a clear objective, overwhelming force,  and an exit strategy.) and another is that he actually believes what he  says, and thinks the telecommunications crash is natural, healthy, and  irreversible, and more concentration would be just fine.   ""this is why elections matter,"" reed hundt, who isn't happy about what  has become of his telecom act, told me. it's true that the f.c.c.much  more than, say, the war in afghanistanis a case in which a gore  administration would be acting quite differently from the bush  administration. consumers might have noticed the difference by now, but  there's no question whether communications companies have noticed. the  arbocks are doing better against their internal rivals than they would  have done if gore had won. next election, they'll help the party that  helped them. if the republicans win, policy will tilt further in the  arbocks' favor. if they lose, perhaps the arbocks' rivalsthe  longdistance companies and the telecommunications upstartswith their  friends now in power, will stage a comeback. america's present is not  unrecognizably different from america's past.    gregory alan bolcer, cto  work 1.949.833.2800 gbolcer at endeavors.com  endeavors technology, inc. cell 1.714.928.5476",[],38521,0,0,easy_ham_testing

it has existed for less than half a century, so it is often worthwhile to look to older design disciplines to understand better this new activity. thus, my book principles of programming languages design, evaluation, and implementation, grew out of a study of teaching methods in architecture, primarily, but also of pedagogy in other disciplines, such as aircraft design. perhaps you have also seen analogies drawn between programming languages and cars (fortran  model t, c  dune buggy, etc.). these analogies can be very informative, and can serve as intuition pumps'' to enhance our creativity, but they cannot be used uncritically because they are, in the end, just analogies. ultimately our design decisions must be based on more than analogies, since analogies can be misleading as well as informative. in this essay i'll address the role of aesthetics in programming language design, but i will base my remarks on a book about structural engineering, the tower and the bridge, by david p. billington. although there are many differences between bridges and programming languages, we will find that many ideas and insights transfer rather directly. according to billington, there are three values common to many technological activities, which we can call the three e's'' efficiency, economy and elegance. these values correspond to three dimensions of technology, which billington calls the scientific, social and symbolic dimensions (the three s's). we will consider each in turn. efficiency seeks to minimize resources used in structural engineering, efficiency deals with the amount of material used the basic criterion is safety and the issues are scientific (strength of materials, disposition of forces, etc.). similarly, in programming language design, efficiency is a scientific question dealing with the use of resources. there are many examples where efficiency considerations influenced programming language design (some are reviewed in my principles of programming languages). in the early days, the resources to be minimized were often runtime memory usage and processing time, although compiletime resource utilization was also relevant. in other cases the resource economized was programmer typing time, and there are wellknown cases in which this compromised safety (e.g. fortran's implicit declarations). there are also many wellknown cases in which security (i.e. safety) was sacrificed for the sake of efficiency by neglecting runtime error checking (e.g. array bounds checking). efficiency issues often can be quantified in terms of computer memory or time, but we must be careful that we are not comparing apples and oranges. compile time is not interchangeable run time, and neither one is the same as programmer time. similarly, computer memory cannot be traded off against computer time unless both are reduced to a common denominator, such as money, but this brings in economic considerations, to which we now turn. economy seeks to maximize benefit versus cost whereas efficiency is a scientific issue, economy is a social issue. in structural engineering, economy seeks to maximize social benefit compared to its cost. (this is especially appropriate since structures like bridges are usually built at public expense for the benefit of the public.) in programming language design, the public'' that must be satisfied is the programming community that will use the language and the institutions for which these programmers work. economic tradeoffs are hard to make because economic values change and are difficult to predict. for example, the shift from first to second generation programming languages was largely a result of a decrease in the cost of computer time compared to programmer time, the shift from the second to the third generation involved the increasing cost of residual bugs in programs, and the fourth generation reflected the increasing cost of program maintenance compared to program development. other social factors involved in the success or failure of a programming language include whether major manufacturers support the language, whether prestigious universities teach it, whether it is approved in some way by influential organizations (such as the us department of defense), whether it has been standardized, whether it comes to be perceived as a real'' language (used by real programmers'') or as a toy'' language (used by novices or dilettantes), and so forth. as can be seen from the historical remarks in my principles, social factors are frequently more important than scientific factors in determining the success or failure of a programming language. often economic issues can be quantified in terms of money, but the monetary values of costs and benefits are often unstable and unpredictable because they depend on changing market forces. also, many social issues, from dissatisfaction with poorly designed software to human misery resulting from system failures, are inaccurately represented by the single dimension of monetary cost. all kinds of cost'' and benefit'' must be considered in seeking an economical design. elegance symbolizes good design elegance? who cares about elegance?'' snorts the hardnosed engineer, but billington shows clearly the critical role of elegance in hardnosed'' engineering. for the designer it is wellknown that feature interaction poses a serious problem for language designers because of the difficulty of analyzing all the possible interactions of features in a language (see my principles for examples). structural engineers face similar problems of analytic complexity, but billington observes that the best designers don't make extensive use of computer models and calculation. one reason is that mathematical analysis is always incomplete. the engineer must make a decision about which variables are significant and which are not, and an analysis may lead to incorrect conclusions if this decision is not made well. also, equations are often simplified (e.g., made linear) to make their analysis feasible, and this is another potential source of error. because of these limitations, engineers that depend on mathematical analysis may overdesign a structure to compensate for unforeseen effects left out of the analysis. thus the price of safety is additional material and increased cost (i.e. decreased efficiency and economy). similarly in programming language design, the limitations of the analytic approach often force us to make a choice between an underengineered design, in which we run the risk of unanticipated interactions, and an overengineered design, in which we have confidence, but which is inefficient or uneconomical. many people have seen the famous film of the collapse in 1940 of the fourmonthold tacoma narrows bridge it vibrated itself to pieces in a storm because aerodynamical stability had not been considered in its design. billington explains that this accident, along with a number of less dramatic bridge failures, was a consequence of an increasing use of theoretical analyses that began in the 1920s. however, the very problem that destroyed the tacoma narrows bridge had been anticipated and avoided a century before by bridge designers who were guided by aesthetic principles. according to billington, the best structural engineers do not rely on mathematical analysis (although they do not abandon it altogether). rather, their design activity is guided by a sense of elegance. this is because solutions to structural engineering problems are usually greatly underdetermined, that is, there are many possible solutions to a particular problem, such as bridging a particular river. therefore, expert designers restrict their attention to designs in which the interaction of the forces is easy to see. the design looks unbalanced if the forces are unbalanced, and the design looks stable if it is stable. the general principle is that designs that look good will also be good, and therefore the design process can be guided by aesthetics without extensive (but incomplete) mathematical analysis. billington expresses this idea by inverting the old architectural maxim and asserting that, in structural design, function follows form. he adds (p. 21), when the form is well chosen, its analysis becomes astoundingly simple.'' in other words, the choice of form is open and free, so we should pick forms where elegant design expresses good design (i.e. efficient and economical design). if we do so, then we can let aesthetics guide design. the same applies to programming language design. by restricting our attention to designs in which the interaction of features is manifest  in which good interactions look good, and bad interactions look bad  we can let our aesthetic sense guide our design and we can be much more confident that we have a good design, without having to check all the possible interactions. for the user in this case, what's good for the designer also is good for the user. nobody is comfortable crossing a bridge that looks like it will collapse at any moment, and nobody is comfortable using a programming language in which features may explode'' if combined in the wrong way. the manifest balance of forces in a welldesigned bridge gives us confidence when we cross it. so also, the manifestly good design of our programming language should reinforce our confidence when we program in it, because we have (welljustified) confidence in the consequences of our actions. we accomplish little by covering an unbalanced structure in a beautiful facade. when the bridge is unable to sustain the load for which it was designed, and collapses, it won't much matter that it was beautiful on the outside. so also in programming languages. if the elegance is only superficial, that is, if it is not the manifestation of a deep coherence in the design, then programmers will quickly see through the illusion and loose their (unwarranted) confidence. in summary, good designers choose to work in a region of the design space where good designs look good. as a consequence, these designers can rely on their aesthetic sense, as can the users of the structures (bridges or programming languages) they design. we may miss out on some good designs this way, but they are of limited value unless both the designer and the user can be confident that they are good designs. we may summarize the preceding discussion in a maxim analogous to those in my principles of programming languages the elegance principle confine your attention to designs that look good because they are good. the programming language as work environment there are other reasons that elegance is relevant to a wellengineered programming language. the programming language is something the professional programmer will live with  even live in. it should feel comfortable and safe, like a welldesigned home or office in this way it can contribute to the quality of the activities that take place within it. would you work better in an oriental garden or a sweatshop? a programming language should be a joy to use. this will encourage its use and decrease the programmer's fatigue and frustration. the programming language should not be a hindrance, but should serve more as a collaborator, encouraging programmers to do their jobs better. as some automobiles are driving machines'' and work as a natural extension of the driver, so a programming language should be a programming machine'' by encouraging the programmer to acquire the smooth competence and seemingly effortless skill of a virtuoso. the programming language should invite the programmer to design elegant, efficient and economical programs. through its aesthetic dimension a programming language symbolizes many values. for example, in the variety of its features it may symbolize profligate excess, sparing economy or asceticism the kind of its features may represent intellectual sophistication, downtoearth practicality or ignorant crudeness. thus a programming language can promote a set of values. by embodying certain values, it encourages us to think about them by neglecting or negating other values, it allows them to recede into the background and out of our attention. out of sight, out of mind. acquiring a sense of elegance aesthetics is notoriously difficult to teach, so you may wonder how you are supposed to acquire that refined sense of elegance necessary to good design. billington observes that this sense is acquired through extensive experience in design, which, especially in europe, is encouraged by a competitive process for choosing bridge designers. because of it, structural engineers design many more bridges than they build, and they learn from each competition they loose by comparing their own designs with those of the winner and other losers. the public also critiques the competing designs, and in this way becomes more educated their sense of elegance develops along with that of the designers. so also, to improve as a programming language designer you should design many languages  design obsessively  and criticize, revise and discard your designs. you should also evaluate and criticize other people's designs and try to improve them. in this way you will acquire the body of experience you will need when the real thing'' comes along. references 1.billington, david p., the tower and the bridge the new art of structural engineering, princeton princeton university press, 1983. chapters 1 and 6

'northern ireland is a british province of green valleys and  cloudcovered hills whose 1.6 million people are politically and  religiously divided. about 54 percent of the population is protestant,  and most protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part  of britain. the roman catholic minority is predominantly republican, or  nationalist they want to merge with the republic of ireland to the south. yep, all because the scots ate oats and starved their irish out long ago, while the english preferred wheat and that doesn't grow so well in ireland. that and the introduction of potatoes saved the irish as irish.  that's fine, as it would be an inappropriate concentration. it would be  difficult to address the issues raised here in a clean way. i'd be  happy with an acknowledgement that the connection is there. oh, i think we are in a war with wide aspects of the muslim religion. i know it is there, but it just might not be appropriate to admit it publicly.  3. us leadership remains reflexively multicultural.    this is ok to a point, as long as it doesn't shy away from logical,  objective analysis of when a society could be seriously improved in  certain ways. i didn't say this was a good thing. with the exception of ethnic restaurants, i can generally be counted on to oppose anything labeled 'multicultural'.  i didn't say burning the train was a good thing. i said i understood it  wasn't a spontaneous attack on people who had done no wrong.     true, although i don't think you were as clear originally. ) i'm sure i wasn't.",[],3421,0,0,easy_ham_testing

That's a steppe too far,zzzzteana emigrate to russia? that's a steppe too far,"the electronic telegraph emigrate to russia? that's a steppe too far (filed 28082002) so you think you've got it bad fed up with folkestone, bored with birmingham or sick of sheffield. those 54 per cent of britons  according to a daily telegraphyougov survey this week  who dream of a stressfree life in sunnier climes should perhaps heed a word of friendly advice on the realities of living abroad. kommersant, a russian daily newspaper, yesterday offered those dissatisfied with life in blair's britain a taste of what to expect should they choose to emigrate to provincial russia. after reading about the gripes of affluent britons, its tongueincheek article admitted, however, that the grass was not always greener on the other side. ""the inhabitants of foggy albion keen to travel could go to any russian city deep in the provinces where things are quiet,"" said kommersant. ""in any central russian district, life, by british standards, is unseemingly cheap and remarkably laid back. by 11am most of the working population are becoming 'traditionally' relaxed."" the time for elevenses in britain  perhaps the opportunity for a quiet cup of tea and a chocolate hobnob  is known in russia as the wolf hour. it was so named in soviet times because at 11am a wolf appeared from the famous animal clock at the obrasov puppet theatre in moscow. it is also opening time in the nation's vodka shops. and the vodka, like all other spirits, is cheap. kommersant pointed out that ""the money a briton can earn from selling even the most shabby house would be enough to support them at the local standard of living for the rest of their life. ""the local shops are full of all they would need and they could buy a bottle of whisky for kopecks."" there are 100 kopecks in a ruble and the ruble is currently worth about a halfpenny in sterling. the whisky is cheap, however, because it is unlike anything the average briton will have consumed before. it is made of samagon  homedistilled, moonshine vodka  coloured with tea, and is a popular beverage in rural areas and among diehard alcoholics. while alcohol is plentiful and cheap, food may not be so easy to come by. the newspaper pointed out that traditional british foodstuffs  it selected oxtail soup as an example  were in short supply. however, the wealth of the british settler should overcome the difficulty. ""for a modest reward in most russian villages, the locals would happily cut off the tails from the entire collective farm's herd of cattle."" one or two potential emigrs might be deterred by language difficulties. there are few english speakers to be found among the green hills of tula on the mongolian border. however, kommersant pointed out, language difficulties were not considered a deterrent by the 13 per cent of britons who nominated france as the country in which they would like to live. france, the russian paper claimed, was a country ""where english is only known by the beggars, belorussian prostitutes and russian tourists"". despite the low cost of living and the easygoing lifestyle, the russian weather remains a major stumbling block for britons. even in the most temperate regions, winter temperatures of 20c are common. and somewhere like the sakha republic  east of siberia and the coldest place in the world  enjoys just one month of summer and endures winter temperatures that drop below 70c. houses are built on concrete stilts because the permafrost makes digging foundations impossible. again, the russian paper had a word of reassurance. while acknowledging the climatic problems, it said that ""thanks to global warming this difficulty will solve itself"". kommersant also had an answer to the labour crisis that would be created in britain if 54 per cent of its citizens decided to opt for a life in russia. ""thirtythree million russians could be sent to britain to replace the 33 million who leave. we think that the required number could probably be found amongst our citizens."" unfortunately for those 33 million russians, however, not one of those britons surveyed who wanted to move abroad nominated the russian steppes as their preferred new home.  yahoo! groups sponsor  4 dvds free sp join now  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to your use of yahoo! groups is subject to",[],4674,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""it looked like a bison skull,"" the building contractor and amateur archaeologist recalls. ""i thought, 'that's strange. bison don't live this high up.' "" knapp brought the skull to the denver museum of nature and science, where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a bisonone that died about 340 years ago. ""this was an extraordinary discovery,"" says russ graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. ""there's probably a lot more like it yet to be found."" and not just bison. colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and snowfields are melting. decades of unusual warmth in regions from peru to alaskaa trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and industryhave shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. as the ice recedes, a treasuretrove of human and animal artifacts is emerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze. the fabrics, wood, bone, and dnarich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our predecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued. ""it's mindboggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains,"" says johan reinhard, a highaltitude archaeologist and explorerinresidence at the national geographic society. rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the andes of peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300yearold ""ice man,"" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the alps in 1991, have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information. now, as the ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains. vanishing act. the trick is finding such specimens before mother natureand looterstake them first. once uncovered, frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. moreover, they're often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them don't even realize they're ancient. that was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in british columbia, canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal. ""it looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,"" recalls warren ward, a teacher from nearby nelson. ""but when i looked closer i could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones."" figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur trapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a ziploc bag and delivered them to local officials. archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what seemed to be a medicine bag. carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about 550 years ago. dubbed kwaday dan ts'inchi, or long ago person found, by people of the champagne and aishihik first nations (who may be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the bestpreserved human from the period ever found in north america. other findings from melting ice in the neighboring yukon region could explain what that longago person was doing in the mountains in the first place. ""before this there was no archaeological record of people living here,"" says greg hare, a yukon government archaeologist. ""now we see that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities."" like ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when kristin benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband, gerry kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south yukon. they followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung. ""it was really odd, because i knew there hadn't been caribou in the area for at least 100 years,"" recalls kuzyk, then a wildlife biologist with the yukon government. caribou cake. returning a week later, he found ""what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it."" it turned out to be a 4,300yearold atlatl, or spear thrower. further investigation of the ice patchand scores of others around the regionrevealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800 years of changing hunting practices. scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies. hunters followed the game. they returned for centuries and discarded some equipment in the ice. ""we've got people hunting with throwing darts up until 1,200 years ago,"" says hare, who now oversees the research project. ""then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about 1,300 years ago. and by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwing darts."" now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. they are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in alaska's wrangell and st. elias mountain rangesthe united states' most glaciated terrainand in the andes. johan reinhard thinks the fast thawing european alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as the ice man.

a cheeky letter to the editors of the economist follows, along with the article i was commenting on... rohit in your article about chinese attempts to censor google last week (""the search goes on"", sept. 19th), the followup correctly noted that the most subversive aspect of google's service is not its card catalog, which merely points surfers in the right direction, but the entire library. by maintaining what amounts to a live backup of the entire world wide web, if you can get to google's cache, you can read anything you'd like. the techniques chinese internet service providers are using to enforce these rules, however, all depend on the fact that traffic to and from google, or indeed almost all public websites, is unencrypted. almost all web browsers, however, include support for secure sockets layer (ssl) encryption for securing credit card numbers and the like. upgrading to ssl makes it effectively impossible for a 'maninthemiddle' to meddle censorship would have to be imposed on each individual computer in china. the only choice left is to either ban the entire site (range of ip addresses), but not the kind of selective filtering reported on in the article. of course, the additional computing power to encrypt all this traffic costs real money. if the united states is so concerned about the free flow of information, why shouldn't the broadcasting board of governors sponsor an encrypted interface to google, or for that matter, the rest of the web? to date, public diplomacy efforts have focused on publicsector programming for the voice of america, radio sawa, and the like. just imagine if the us government got into the business of subsidizing secure access to privatesector media instead. nothing illustrates the freedom of the press as much as the wacky excess of the press itself  and most of it is already salted away at google and the internet archive project. on second thought, i can hardly imagine this administration promoting the use of encryption to uphold privacy rights. never mind... best, rohit khare  the search goes on china backtracks on banning googleup to a point sep 19th 2002  beijing from the economist print edition in chinese, the nickname for google, an american internet search engine, is gougou, meaning doggy. for the country's fastgrowing population of internet users (46m, according to an official estimate), it is proving an elusive creature. earlier this month, the chinese authorities blocked access to google from internet service providers in chinaapparently because the search engine helped chinese users to get access to forbidden sites. now, after an outcry from those users, access has been restored. an unusual climbdown by china's zealous internet censors? hardly. more sophisticated controls have now been imposed that make it difficult to use google to search for material deemed offensive to the government. access is still blocked to the cached versions of web pages taken by google as it trawls the internet. these once provided a handy way for chinese users to see material stored on blocked websites. after the blocking of google on august 31st, many chinese internet users posted messages on bulletin boards in china protesting against the move. their anger was again aroused last week when some chinese internet providers began rerouting users trying to reach the blocked google site to far less powerful search engines in china. duncan clark, the head of a beijingbased technology consultancy firm, bda (china) ltd, says china is trying a new tactic in its efforts to censor the internet. until recently, it had focused on blocking individual sites, including all pages stored on them. now it seems to be filtering data transmitted to or from foreign websites to search for key words that might indicate undesirable content. for example earlier this week when using eastnet, a beijingbased internet provider, a search on google for falun gonga quasibuddhist exercise sect outlawed in china usually aborted before all the results had time to appear. such a search also rendered google impossible to use for several minutes.",[],5544,0,0,easy_ham_testing

anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad? low quality, small in size. but kids totally dug that stuff. seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point. and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs. i don't think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography  developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc. i think it expands the market and forms a new category. the extent of the category size is the big question (will it be a fad or will it a sustained market). that's consumer behavior and marketing. but i don't think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market (in this case, digital photos or normal photos). europe's the one to watch  more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right, they'll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them. h from ""rob shavell"" to ""'mike masnick'"" cc subject re sprint delivers the next big thing?? date wed, 21 aug 2002 011050 0700  right mike,  i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart. my opinion is only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instant show') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing). i am mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting.  my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways once there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they see amongst each other. that doesn't mean that people will stop talking on their phones, or that people will spend more time wimages than voice. just that it is fundamental. from news to crime to privacy to dating to family life to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosion of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of photography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changes things 'big time'.  rgds, rob   original message from mike masnick sent tuesday, august 20, 2002 1158 pm to rob shavell cc subject re sprint delivers the next big thing??   not to keep harping on this, but...  at 1136 pm 82002 0700, rob shavell wrote  content who cares about content? that no one can think of 'useful' content is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users communications. its anything and everything. avg person could easily send half dozen pics to a dozen people a day. mainly humorous i'd guess. who cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words.  this does nothing to answer my question. i do care about content. hell, if i could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day, i'd have a different opinion of this. i just am not convinced that they will (stupid or not).  while a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who communicate by pictures? sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something?  i don't buy it.  for most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism. for some messages, pictures do the job, but i would say not nearly as often as words. why do you think pictionary and charades and such are games? because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across.  misc ramblings i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same thing about '1 hour photo' processing. trivial, who needs it, i get better resultion elswhere. and yet, it had great decentralizing impact  the plant had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation  the digital camera, and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way. also, sms didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less. its greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their sms traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth. in reality, sms cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.  again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with ""you just don't understand kids today, and they'll run with this""). i wasn't saying that mms wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't easy. i was saying that i couldn't see why people would use it in a way that ""changed the face of communications"".  i'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why people would want to do this. sure, if they integrate cameras into the phone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) i can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people. but, mostly, i don't see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or offline) photoalbum.  i don't think 1 hour photos are trivial. people want to see their own pics right away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots. that's one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on. the instant view part. i'm guessing your argument is that people not only want ""instant view"", but also ""instant show"". which is what this service offers. i'm not convinced that most people want ""instant show"". i think people like to package their pictures and show them. that's why people put together fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture. sure, occasionally ""instant show"" is nice, but it's just ""nice"" on occasion. i still can't see how it becomes a integral messaging method.  what's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another? there has to be some benefit, even if it's silly if people are going to flock to it.  i'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.  the only really intriguing idea i've heard about things like mms lately are dan gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of what happened  before the press even gets there.  willing to be proven wrong, mike  ps if the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are, then mms is never going to catch on.",[],7240,0,0,easy_ham_testing

trouble for 3g, reports peter rojas peter rojas thursday august 29, 2002 the guardian imagine being able to surf the net at speeds faster than dsl from anywhere, at any time  you could watch a live video webcast while waiting for the bus, email photos to your friends while sitting in the park, or download the mp3 of the song that's playing in the pub before it finishes. this is the vision of a highspeed wireless internet paradise that the thirdgeneration (3g) mobile phone companies have been promoting for years. 3g services are just beginning to be rolled out, but a new technology called mesh networking promises to deliver on this vision sooner and more effectively than the mobile phone companies could ever dream. two companies, us startup meshnetworks and moteran networks of germany, are each developing their own competing version of mesh networking. instead of the current hubandspoke model of wireless communications, with every device connecting to an overburdened central antenna, any time ""meshenabled"" devices  mobile phones, pdas, laptops  are in close proximity to each other, they automatically create a wireless mesh network. every device in the area acts as a repeater or router, relaying traffic for everyone else. traffic hops from person to person until it reaches the nearest internet access point, reducing the need for central antennas, and improving wireless coverage. as the number of mobile phones soars, and wireless pdas, laptops, and other devices begin to crowd the spectrum, this approach to wireless networking may be inevitable. mesh networks also have several other advantages over 3g wireless networks. while 3g operators roll out mobile services that offer users connection speeds of up to 144 kbps (roughly three times faster than a dialup modem), moteran and meshnetworks are able to offer connection speeds of up to 6mbps, over a hundred times faster than dialup. the technologies they use include wifi  the emerging standard for highspeed wireless networking also known as 802.11b. a similarly shortrange protocol called ultrawideband, which is poised to succeed wifi, is even faster and could, by 2005, approach 400 mbps. the range of a typical wifi network is generally too limited to be of much use when travelling around a city. mesh networks get around the problem of coverage by having every device in the network relay traffic. even though the range of any individual device is relatively small, because (in theory) there will be so many users in the surrounding area, connections will be faster and better than that of a standard 3g wireless connection. because mesh networks use wifi, the equipment and infrastructure needed to create them is cheap and readily available. instead of building cellular phone towers that often cost hundreds of thousands of pounds, all that is needed to get a network going are wireless access points (around 100 now) placed strategically around town to relay traffic, and the proper software. existing laptops and pdas can be meshenabled by software. it also means that anyone could set up their own mobile phone network. unlike with 3g cellular, the part of the spectrum that wifi operates on is unregulated in the us, britain. the mobile phone companies are none too pleased about this, especially since many of them spent billions of pounds acquiring 3g licences. all that's needed are cheap relays and mobile phones equipped to connect to the network. with every additional customer that signs up coverage gets better, instead of getting worse, as is the case with mobile phone networks. but things get very interesting when you realise that when you have highspeed internet connections everywhere, and everyone's laptops, pdas, and mobile phones are connected together at blazingly fast speeds, sharing music, movies, or whatever else becomes ridiculously easy. when ultrawideband hits, all of this will just accelerate. at 400mbps, copying a pirated copy of the lord of the rings from the person sitting across from you at the cafe would take about 15 seconds. sooner or later, playgrounds will be filled with kids swapping files of their favourite songs, movies, and video games. but the first mesh networks are not likely to be available to consumers. meshnetworks has no plans to offer its own highspeed wireless service. instead the company plans to sell its technology to others, such as cities that want to provide wireless internet to police, fire, and public works employees, or businesses that want to establish wireless networks on the cheap. moteran has similar aspirations for small businesses and for enterprise networks. the first place average users may use the technology is when it is incorporated into vehicles, enabling motorists to access the internet at high speeds, which both companies see happening soon. when will you be able to wander around town with a 6mbps connection in your pocket? it's too soon to say, but just as broadband internet service was initially available only to businesses and universities, eventually someone will see the profit in bringing mesh networking to the masses.",[],5366,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""some prosecutions that make that clear could be very helpful...i think they would think twice if they thought there was a risk of criminal prosecution,"" said riaa president cary sherman, who was on the same conference panel. i'm not too confident that lawsuits would have the effect sherman is hoping for. although infrequent, there have already been civil suits or warnings issued to private individuals, and they have served as minor deterrents to the filesharing community at large. criminal lawsuits carrying with them the possibility of prison sentences may generate further animosity against groups such as the riaa and may be difficult to initiate because of the ""schooling"" effect of millions of systems participating in file sharing. only servers would seem to stand out from the crowd. the article cites the no electronic theft (net) act 2, which defines illegal activity and maximum penalties for copyright infringement criminal infringement any person who infringes a copyright willfully for purposes of commercial advantage or private financial gain, or by the reproduction or distribution, including by electronic means, during any 180day period, of 1 or more copies or phonorecords of 1 or more copyrighted works, which have a total retail value of more than $1,000.... for purposes of this subsection, evidence of reproduction or distribution of a copyrighted work, by itself, shall not be sufficient to establish willful infringement. ... the term ""financial gain"" includes receipt, or expectation of receipt, of anything of value, including the receipt of other copyrighted works. therefore, receipt of a work of value would be defined as ""financial gain"" even if no money is involved. the net act excerpt does not clarify how the value of a work is determined an album or movie could be worth only $15 to millions of dollars depending on whether the value is assessed from the perspective of the consumer or copyright holder. the statute of limitations 507. limitations on actions (a) criminal proceedings.no criminal proceeding shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within five years after the cause of action arose. (b) civil actions.no civil action shall be maintained under the provisions of this title unless it is commenced within three years after the claim accrued. the penalties are too extensive to list here, but they can be found in section 2319 criminal infringement of a copyright. in general, firsttime criminal offenses will carry a maximum prison sentence of 1 year. i'm still not sure where the doj would start in choosing people to prosecute because of the aforementioned ""schooling"" effect, but my guess would be that, just like speeding, primarily the most prominent individuals who operate large servers or transfer the most data will be targeted in order to discourage more recreational file sharers. thanks to monalisaoverdrive for pointing out this story.

fork@spamassassin.taint.org",The Disappearing Alliance,the disappearing alliance,"the disappearing alliance by dale franks 10082002 for over two generations, the countries of western europe have been our closest allies. we stood beside each other through the darkest days of the cold war as partners in the north atlantic treaty organization. we celebrated with them over the fall of the soviet empire and the liberation of eastern europe from the yoke of communism. tragically, a generation from now, we may be bitter adversaries. europe has increasingly fallen under the spell of a political ideology that hudson institute scholar john fonte has termed ""progressive transnationalism"". the key doctrines of this form of postcommunist progressivism contain some fairly pernicious ideas. among these are the deconstruction of nationalism, the promotion of postnationalist ideas of citizenship (i.e. a ""global"" citizenry), a redefinition of democracy, and the pooling of national sovereignty into multinational groups such as the united nations. the european union, itself a multinational organization built through the pooling of sovereignty by european nations, is postdemocratic. while there is a european parliament, the eu's power resides mainly in the unelected european commission (ec) and its unelected president, who face few limits to their power. instead of a limited, consensual form of government, where elected representatives promulgate constitutional laws, the eu has an appointed, oligarchic executive, along with a large attendant bureaucracy, whose orders are not constitutionally limited in any real sense. moreover, the eu has been unwilling to accept the democratically expressed wishes of the people themselves when those wishes conflict with the results desired by the eu's political elite. both the ec and the european court of justice regularly overturn the national laws of democratically elected eu member governments. this is a step backward in europe's political development. european criticism of america is on the rise, and the european list of complaints about america is a long and growing one. they dislike the fact that our republican system of government is not based on proportional representation. they hate the fact that our citizens own guns. they despise the fact that we execute murderers. they resent the fact that our economy is so large, and that americans consume so much. they also resent?and fear  the fact that we have the ability to project american power anywhere in the world. on august 9, 2002, adrian hamilton wrote a column in the uk's independent newspaper, in which he identified the us as a rogue state who should be restrained, perhaps by a european military invasion, followed by a decade or so of occupation. fortunately, the article is satirical not because it exaggerates the way european progressives view the us, but rather because the impotence of european military power makes the idea of an invasion of the us literally fantastic. at least, for now. despite the tongueincheek nature of this editorial, however, the fact remains that america is increasingly viewed this way by the european intellectual and political elite. the europeans actively desire a world where the united nations keeps in check the activities of sovereign states. because they have built such a system in europe, they feel it's valid for the rest of the world. america, however, is the biggest obstacle to such a system. the europeans cannot understand why america places a higher value on the ethos of national sovereignty and limited, consensual, and constitutional government, than it does on compliance with international ""norms."" they view all departures from such norms as aberrant. because the un member states all have an equal vote in prescribing international norms, they assume that, since the process is ostensibly legitimate, the results must be as well. the trouble with this idea, of course, is that it gives the views of nondemocratic, authoritarian states the same weight as those of free, democratic societies. it sanctifies the process, with no regard to the actual results. thus, they are unable to make any moral distinction between the us refusals to join in a given international effort because we wish to preserve the liberty of our citizens, and similar refusals from iraq because its dictator wishes to maintain his firm grip on power. our repeated references to the us constitution, and our unwillingness to bypass its provisions to comply with international norms, are incomprehensible to them. they assume, therefore, that our refusal is based on arrogance, rather than on a commitment to constitutional rights. none of this bodes well for the future of euroamerican friendship, or cooperation. if the europeans continue to reject traditional liberalism in favor of the new progressivism, their criticism of the us will rise, while their tolerance of our differences will fall. obviously, in such a political atmosphere, the opportunities for conflict will inevitably increase. that thought is frightening enough. even more frightening, however, is the thought that such a conflict might be averted by our own acceptance of the new ideology of transnational progressivism.   r. a. hettinga mailto the internet bearer underwriting corporation  44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa ""... however

icke (  gordon  original message  from ""mr. fork"" to sent monday, september 30, 2002 1011 pm subject dinosaurs eggs and the origins of good and evil  one of the most bizarre pages i've seen on the web. at first i thought it  might be some sort of backstory to a rpg, but, nope, it looks like somebody  believes this.       m09. dinosaurs eggs and the origins of good and evil.  dinosaurs. reptoid ets are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on  their hind legs. this is a description of a dinosaur. it now appears in  remote viewing that the reptoid ets, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked  together and that they all originated on earth. the erideans who are reptoid  derivatives have a home planet (in the eridanus system) like all other ets.  the reptoids have no reported home planet. they also come over as entities  with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. this is a  description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see  them. thus it could be that the reptoids, erideans, nordics, anunnaki, but  not the greys, all have origins on earth and have a strong link to earth  even if they choose to live elsewhere. the greys do not appear to have a  renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on earth.  the definitive work on dragons is ""the flight of dragons"" by peter  dickinson. if dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long  bow. targets do not come much bigger.   truth is stranger than fiction. thus the writer's current scenario is that  there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard  their eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. they  survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty.  they evolved into the erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet  (for them) possibly with the help of another race of ets who wanted slaves  but otherwise had no interest in earth or mind control.   thus it appears that the current reptoids are the spirits or ghosts of the  dinosaurs. they must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also  to appear to some people. they have appeared to the writer in remote  viewing. they are living on as vampire entities. such immortal minds are  contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. if they can be  encouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and  mind controllers will disappear. encouraging them to reincarnate will help  so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great  difficulty surviving reincarnation. purging people's dinosaurs should remove  all perverse psychic abilities not under their control. they are a source of  satanic guardian angels and demons. they control us by owning our psi. thus  if we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of  all other mind controllers. encourage people to regain ownership of their  psi.   the origins of love, hate and pure malice. the following scenario appears to  hold water and can account for the origins of our universal subconscious.   dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of  rotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young  hatchelings). they did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made  them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. in order to  keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. to do this  they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. this is an  act of hatred and outward looking. while a few dinosaurs did develop the  ability to bear living young, most did not. the dinosaurs got in first and  so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. they have  become the source of all satans, devils and demons.   birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep  them warm. a hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and  only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. thus all eggs tend  to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. this is  primarily an act of love but inward looking. bearing live young is not  suitable to a bird of the air. a pregnant pigeon would not fly very far.  antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm,  even if they are standing on ice.   mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act  of love and inward looking. this is especially true as a mammalian female  can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird  sitting on a nest.   dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young,  while birds and mammals developed love. birds and mammals certainly do hate  all enemies of their young, but this is secondary.   if one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then  purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. unfortunately most of our  religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control,  regardless of the front they put out to the public. religion tends to  concentrate on ""how to brainwash your neighbour"". conscious thought has  built many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using  ""how to care for and protect one's young"" as a foundation.   thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something ""a load of  dinosaur's eggs"". purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur's eggs of any entity  tends to purge all malice back to its roots.   it looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings,  aided and abetted by various occultists and other. as they will insist on  vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the  serenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate.   items for inspection. for mind control to take place, then someone must take  control or ownership of the target's psi and pleasure centres. check for the  following.   nest of dinosaur's eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc.  eggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing

""duncan"" beberg  epa diesel exhaust can cause cancer wed sep 4, 329 am et by h. josef hebert, associated press writer washington (ap)  inhaling diesel exhausts from large trucks and other sources over time can cause cancer in humans, an environmental protection agency ( news  web sites) report concludes after a decade of study. the epa finding, released tuesday, is expected to buttress the government's push to reduce truck tailpipe emissions by requiring cleanerburning engines and diesel fuel with ultralow sulfur content. while acknowledging uncertainties about the longterm health effects of exposure to diesel exhausts, the epa report said studies involving both animal tests and occupational exposure suggest strong evidence of a cancer risk to humans. ""it is reasonable to presume that the hazard extends to environmental exposure levels"" as well, the report said. ""the potential human health effects of diesel exhausts is persuasive, even though assumptions and uncertainties are involved."" the report mirrors conclusions made previously in documents from various world health agencies and studies in california and is particularly significant because the epa is the federal agency that regulates diesel emissions under the clean air act. some environmentalists have raised concerns recently that the bush administration might try to back away from a clintonera regulation that would establish tougher requirements on emissions from large trucks and a separate rule that virtually would eliminate sulfur from diesel fuel. epa administrator christie whitman repeatedly has promised to go ahead with the tougher truck and diesel rules. last month, with white house approval, the epa rebuffed attempts by some diesel engine manufacturers to postpone the requirements, approving new penalties against manufacturers who fail to meet an october deadline for making cleanerburning truck engines. the engine rule does not affect emissions from trucks already on the road, although the separate regulation cutting the amount of sulfur in diesel fuel is expected to produce pollution reductions. the epa's 651page diesel health assessment did not attempt to estimate the probability of an individual getting cancer, given certain exposure to diesel exhaust. such a risk assessment is commonly made by the epa when gauging pollution health concerns. but in this case, the report said, ""the exposureresponse data are considered too uncertain"" to produce a confident quantitative estimate of cancer risk to an individual. nevertheless, said the report, the ""totality of evidence from human, animal and other supporting studies"" suggests that diesel exhaust ""is likely to be carcinogenic to humans by inhalation, and that this hazard applies to environmental exposure."" the report reiterated that environmental exposure to diesel exhausts poses shortterm health problems and in the long term has been shown to be a ""chronic respiratory hazard to humans"" contributing to increased asthma and other respiratory problems. in some urban areas diesel exhausts account for as much as a quarter of the airborne microscopic soot, the report said. environmentalists welcomed the study as clear evidence that pollution needs to be curtailed not only from large trucks but also from offroad dieselpowered vehicles. epa spokeswoman steffanie bell said the agency expects to publish a rule early next year dealing with those diesel exhaust sources, which include farm tractors and construction equipment. emily figdor of the u.s. public interest research group, a private environmental organization, said ""to reduce the public's exposure to harmful diesel emissions, the bush administration should ... fully implement clean air standards for diesel trucks and buses and should pass equivalent standards for diesel construction and farm equipment."" allen schaeffer, executive director of the industry group diesel technology forum, said the epa's report ""focused on the past,"" whereas ""the future is clean diesel. diesel trucks and buses built today are more than eight times cleaner than just a dozen years ago."" the report acknowledged that its findings were based on emissions levels in the mid1990s, but said the results continued to be valid because the slow turnover of truck engines has kept many of these vehicles on the road.",[],4716,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""our vision is to build out an xmlaware infrastructure,"" kelly said. ""the xa35 is the first of a family."" kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up to 20 times. this, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best alternative. in addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount importance in the world of xml. ""today's firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only,"" kelly said. ""a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall. firewalls are blind to xml today."" future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on security, especially as web services proliferate, kelly said. according to datapower, most existing solutions to offload xml processing are homegrown and done in software  an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security. after trying the software path, the company turned to creating a solution that would process xml in hardware. ""our xg3 execution core converts xml to machine code,"" said kelly, adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do xml processing  claims that he believes will be mostly false. other contentaware switches, such as ssl (secure socket layer) accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, while the xa35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes and thus enabling greater processing of xml data, kelly explained. the 1uhigh network device has been tested against a large collection of xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device. the xa35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are xml, kelly said. in addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application coprocessor. this deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device. datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. startup sarvega, based in burr ridge, ill., introduced the sarvega xpe switch in may, and earlier this month tarari, an intel spinoff, launched with a focus on content processing and acceleration. the datapower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. the company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in field trails at a number of other enterprises.   datapower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was founded in early 1999 by eugene kuznetsov, a technology visionary who foresaw the adverse effects xml and other next generation protocols would have on enterprise networks. long before industry interest in xml grew, kuznetsov assembled a team of worldclass m.i.t. engineers and designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique requirements for processing xml. the first such solution was a software interpreter called dgxt. this softwarebased approach to xml processing is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today. leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from developing softwarebased accelerators, kuznetsov's team raised the bar and designed a system for processing xml in purposebuilt hardware. in 2001, datapower's effort produced xml generation three (xg3tm), the industry's fastest technology for xml processing, bar none. today, xg3tm technology powers the industry's first wirespeed xml network devices, enabling secure, highspeed applications and xml web services. while other companies are just now marketing first versions of products, datapower is delivering its third generation of technology, providing an immediate return on technology investments to industryleading customers and partners. datapower's m.i.t. heritage is complemented by a management team that brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including akamai, argon, cascade, castle networks, sycamore and wellfleet.   datapower technology secures $9.5 million in funding venrock associates, mobius venture capital and seed capital back pioneer in xmlaware networking for web services cambridge, mass.  july 8, 2002  datapower technology, inc., the leading provider of xmlaware network infrastructure, today announced that it has secured $9.5 million in series b financing. investors for this round include venrock associates, mobius venture capital and seed capital partners. michael tyrrell, of venrock, bill burnham, of mobius, and jeff fagnan, of seed capital, have joined datapowers board of directors. datapower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and sales of the companys breakthrough technology for xmlaware networking. founded in 1999, datapower invented the worlds first intelligent xml networking devices, capable of transforming xml traffic and transactions at the wirespeed enterprises need to effectively embrace web services and other xmlcentric initiatives. datapowers solutions are based on its patentpending xml generation three (xg3tm) technology. ""enterprises are adopting xml at rapid rate to facilitate interand intracompany communications but their network infrastructure is ill prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. datapowers xmlacceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of xml that is required to support next generation enterprise applications,"" said eugene kuznetsov, cto and founder of datapower technology. ""datapower gives companies the ability to use xml thats critical to web services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" a single datapower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 serversbreaking the performance bottleneck associated with xml processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. in addition, the datapower platform provides enhanced xml security, protection against xmlbased denialofservice attacks, connection of ebusiness protocols for incompatible xml data streams, load balancing between backend servers and realtime statistics reports. ""in the postbubble economy, technology investment decisions require laserfocused scrutiny. datapowers patentpending technology addresses a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said michael tyrrell of venrock associates. ""by turbocharging their networks with datapowers unique xmlaware networking technology, companies will be free to adopt next generation web services without encountering performance and security pitfalls."" ""we looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly growing problems surrounding xml message processing performance and security,"" said bill burnham of mobius venture capital. ""datapower is on their third generation of technology. their patent pending xml generation three (xg3) technology was quite simply the single most compelling technology solution we have seen to date."" ""xml is not a nicetohave, it is a must have for enterprises serious about optimizing application efficiency. since 1999, datapower has been developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of xml and web services,"" said jeff fagnan of seed capital partners. ""datapowers xmlacceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely on xml for mission critical applications."" about venrock associates venrock associates was founded as the venture

'exploited' locals said they believed that lord hanuman was visiting the village, as the temple had stopped daily rituals after a dispute between two groups of residents. but animal rights campaigners complained that the animal was being mistreated. they filed a petition in the state's high court saying the monkey had been forcibly confined in the temple. the group also alleged that people's religious feelings were being exploited to make money. the court then ordered the local administration to rescue the monkey  but villagers prevented officials from taking him for treatment in time.",[],1972,0,0,easy_ham_testing

iq? purity of heart? or the ability to satisfy customers? functionally most people seem to equate merit with iq though they say it would be better if it were purity of heart. yet the type of merit that lands you on the forbes list, or even just being a garden variety 'millionaire next door' is more likely to be the 'serving customers' definition. differences due to merit, when they are perceived as such, generate far more animosity than differences due to luck. luck can be forgiven. superior performance, often not.  original message  from on behalf of geege  schuman  sent monday, september 23, 2002 444 pm  to r. a. hettinga geege schuman owen byrne  cc gary lawrence murphy mr. fork digital bearer  settlement list  subject re comrade communism (was re crony capitalism (was re sed  sunited statesroman empireg))   first, misattribution. i did not write the blurb below. i made one  statement about vp cheney only, to wit, that he has a short memory.   i couldn't agree with you more on this ""in short, then, economics is not  a  zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the  backs  of the poor, and redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit  is just that horseshit, happy or otherwise,"" however, i resent being  lumped  in a zerosumzealot category for suggesting nothing more than that rich  and  successful at face value is apropos of nothing and i am beginning to  understand that people who immediately and so fiercely object to my ad  hominem (re cheney) align themselves weird sylogisms like ""if rich then  deservedly"" or ""if rich then smarter."" given that, i am also beginning to  understand why some people need to be rich.   wrt to meritocracies  all hail, meritocracies! wrt harvard over 90% of  2002 graduates were cum laude . interesting curve. those eager to be  measured got their wish those unwashed shy folk who just live it provide  the balast.   speaking of forbes, was reading about peter norton just today in an old  issue while waiting for my doctor. norton attributes his success to luck.  imagine.   geege   original message  from r. a. hettinga  sent sunday, september 22, 2002 1001 pm  to geege schuman owen byrne  cc gary lawrence murphy mr. fork digital bearer  settlement list  subject comrade communism (was re crony capitalism (was re sed  sunited statesroman empireg))    begin pgp signed message  hash sha1   at 1115 am 0400 on 92202, geege schuman wrote     most of them seem to have ivy league educations, or are ivy league   dropouts suggesting to me that they weren't exactly poor to start   with.   actually, if i remember correctly from discussion of the list's  composition in forbes about five or six years ago, the best way to  get on the forbes 400 is to have no college at all. can you say  ""bootstraps"", boys and girls?

because, as of about 1950, the best way to get into harvard,  for instance, is to be smart, not rich. don't take my word for it,  ask their admissions office. look at the admissions stats over the  years for proof.   meritocracy, american style, was invented at the ivy league after  world war ii. even stanford got the hint, ), and, of course,  chicago taught them all how, right? ). practically nobody who  goes to a top20 american institution of higher learning can actually  afford to go there these days. unless, of course, their parents, who  couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the  last 40 years or so. and their kids still had to get the grades,  and ""biased"" (by intelligence )), test scores, to get in.    the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal""  degrees, until they actually own something and hire people, or  learn to make something for a living all day on a profit and loss  basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after  death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people  who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone is  smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.   btw, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this  rhetorical stick can blame me for the fact that i'm using it to  beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. you  were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. i went to  missouri, and i don't have a degree in anything actually useful,  much less a ""terminal"" one, which means i'm broker than anyone on  this list  it's just that you, of all people, lots with  educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. the  facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and look.  there are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and  economics is not a zerosum game. the cost of anything, including  ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case,  intelligence and effort.   i will, however, admit to being educated waay past my level of  competence, and, by the way you discuss economics, so have you,  apparently.     btw, if we ever actually had free markets in this country,  including the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes,  all those smart people in the forbes 400 would have more money, and  there would be more selfmade people on that list. in addition,  most of the people who inherited money on the list would have  much less of it, not even relatively speaking. finally, practically  all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and  not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.   that efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in the  people's republics of berkeley or cambridge. it means more and better  stuff, cheaper, over time  a terrible, petitbourgeois concept  apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd  know about it by now. in economic terms, it's also called an increase  in general welfare, and, no, virginia, i'm not talking about  extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who  doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some  politician as santa claus come election time...    in short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not  theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and  redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just  that horseshit, happy or otherwise.   to believe otherwise, is  quite literally, given the time marx  wrote capital and the manifesto  romantic nonsense.   cheers,  rah   begin pgp signature  version pgp 7.5   iqaawubpy511cpxh8jf3ohaeqlasgcfzhsqmsvuy6gqj5wgl52dwzkpihmanrur  yybocicylp5tlkl58jpwefu  z877  end pgp signature       r. a. hettinga mailto  the internet bearer underwriting corporation   44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa  ""... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity,  predicting the end of the world has not been found agreeable to  experience.""  edward gibbon, 'decline and fall of the roman empire'",[],9432,0,0,easy_ham_testing

it one way, the fbiwinter hill vs. patriarchaangiulo cosa nostra fight was just another race war between thugs. put crudely, and at its most racist, the fbi and the winter hill gang were the (mostly) irish thugs, and patriarcha's ""family"" were, of course, the (mostly) italian thugs. think scorsese's upcoming ""gangs of new york"", only with counterreformatory overtones. hoover's south boston ""socialclub"" putsch, starting in the mid 1960's, was particularly audacious in hindsight. the u.s. federal government actually decided to underwrite a reversal of the prohibitionera capture of the nation's rackets by the italians from the irish. the fact that the plot was hatched not for new york, but for south boston, the most irish place in the us, only makes even more gigantic the big lie that was told by the fbi to its ostensible political masters about bringing down organized crime there once and for all. the result, as we all found out, wasn't swapping the heroin of italian boston mob violence for irish methadone. hoover was, posthumously, swapping it for oxycontin, or crystal methamphetamine   or, more properly, pcp. the absolute psychopathology of violence in whitey bulger's crackcocaineera reign of boston's drug markets, like the identical fbisponsored reigns or violent horror by other alsorans in cities across the us as a whole, went up whole orders of magnitude, not mere percentage points. as stalin said once, quantity has a quality all it's own. and, make no mistake, j. edgar hoover was directly responsible that ""quality"" of carnage, nationwide. so, yes, on paper at least, it really was just the swapping of one gang of racist thugs for another, and the result was, on paper, at least, business as usual. same stuff, different century, with apparently decent people like mr. salvati et.al accidently ground on the gears of ""justice"" like so much hamburger. however, to be much more macabre about it, that hamburger was ""greasing"", if you will, an auto de fe only a homicidal lunatic could love a perfectly functioning market, legislated out of existence  on paper, if nowhere else  by government fiat and the, backdoor, but still elitist, will to power of h.l. mencken's famous ""bluenoses and busybodies"". it all starts, like all true evil does, from the most innocent of beginnings. what she couldn't do to alcohol, teatotaling mrs. grundy then tried to do to anything else she could think of that had a smaller, ""manageable"" demand. the bloody result was, like nine more heads of the hydra, an increasingly ubiquitous universal prohibition, in more markets, and for more things, as the 20th century wore on. every time some recreational drug was found to be addictive, or harmful, or physically distasteful, or carcinogenic  or, now, apparently, fattening  and then prohibited, exactly the same thing happened to its markets that happened to alcohol during the volstead years. a larger market than before the prohibition. hugely lucrative profits for anyone with the moral stomach to violently scale newlylegislated ""barriers to competition"" imposed on them by the state. increasingly violent attacks by the government on users of those substances. and, finally, the ultimate in evil  the kind of evil this country actually fought wars to end  increasingly coercive axehandle beatings, by our own government, of the sacred liberty of the average, but now unavoidablylawbreaking, citizenry. as ayn rand cynically observed a long time ago, you don't need government if nobody's breaking the law. in some twisted corollary to parkinson's law, governments, to survive, need more people, breaking more laws, or they can never justify the money they confiscate at tax time. and, to bring us back to the point, david friedman would probably echo here his father milton's famous observation that government regulations only benefit the regulated sellers in a given market, and never the consumer, much less the economy as a whole. even, especially, if those sellers are breaking the law, as they are in the increasingly ubiquitous prohibition of risky behavior that our government now imposes on us. and there, absent the apparent grace of mr. hoover, went mr. salvati. in fact, hayek himself, in ""the road to serfdom"", couldn't have predicted any better the gory consequences of hoover's blatant imposition, ""for our own good"", of vietnamera statist power at the neighborhood level. and, furthermore, stalin couldn't have had better ""useful idiots"" than hoover did  and neither, by an absolutely literal extension, did whitey bulger after hoover. useful idiots on both sides of the congressional aisle. idiots who were eating out of hoover's powercraven hand for the entire middle of the 20th century  and whitey bulger's hand, whether they knew it or not, until the end of the millennium. a time, you'll notice, which saw the increasingly steady imposition of ""mob"" violence, and market control, from both state and illegal interests, way beyond the imaginings of even the most powermad, rumrunning, stockkiting, movieflopping, bureaupumping, naziappeasing irishbostonian little caesar. or, as for that matter, his safely trustfunded, and now strictly political, descendents. in terms of actual financial economics, think of what happened to mr. salvati and the others, dead or alive, as a ""transferprice"", in human lives, of the inevitable consequence of macnamarastyle vietnamera keynesian ""socialcost"" inputoutput accounting at its most despicable, and you can almost begin to fathom the atrocity that was committed by hoover, and his coreligionists in state economic control, in the name of what really was, as you'll now agree, just a race war between thugs up in boston. this shouldn't be a surprise, really. all race wars are at least fought by thugs, though they're usually conceived elsewhere, and endorsed, at the time, by all the ""right"" people, for all the ""right"" reasons. as far as the fbi itself goes, remember mancur olson's observation that a ""prince"" is just a stationary bandit. though, given his penchant for women's clothing, for other men, and, what's actually obscene, for violently hypocritical treatment of people of his own affectional preference, i suppose we can call j. edgar hoover a bandit ""princess"", instead. ""bandit queen"", of course, would be a grievous insult to queens  and real bandits  everywhere. cheers, rah   pagewantedprintpositiontop the new york times august 25, 2002 hoover's f.b.i. and the mafia case of bad bedfellows grows by fox butterfield boston, aug. 24  it was march 1965, in the early days of j. edgar hoover's war against the mafia. f.b.i. agents, say congressional investigators, eavesdropped on a conversation in the headquarters of new england's organizedcrime boss, raymond patriarca. two gangsters, joseph barboza and vincent flemmi, wanted mr. patriarca's permission to kill a smalltime hoodlum, edward deegan, ""as they were having a problem with him,"" according to an f.b.i. log of the conversation. ""patriarca ultimately furnished this o.k.,"" the f.b.i. reported, and three days later mr. deegan turned up dead in an alley, shot six times. it was an extraordinary situation the federal bureau of investigation had evidence ahead of time that two wellknown gangsters were planning a murder and that the head of the new england mafia was involved. but when indictments in the case were handed down in 1967, the real killers  who also happened to be informers for the f.b.i.  were left alone. four other men were tried, convicted and sentenced to death or life in prison for the murder, though they had had nothing to do with it. one, joseph salvati, who spent 30 years in prison, filed notice with the justice department last week that he planned to sue the f.b.i. for $300 million for false imprisonment. his is the latest in a series of lawsuits against the f.b.i., the justice department and some f.b.i. agents growing out of the tangled, corrupt collaboration between gangsters and the f.b.i.'s boston office in its effort to bring down the mob. the lawsuits are based on evidence uncovered in the last five years in a judicial hearing and a justice department inquiry. but some of the most explosive evidence has only recently come to light, including documents detailing conversation in which mr. patriarca approved the murder. they were released as part of an investigation by the house committee on government reform, which has pressured the department into turning over records about the f.b.i in boston. the documents show that officials at f.b.i. headquarters, apparently including mr. hoover, knew as long ago as 1965 that boston agents were employing killers and gang leaders as informers and were protecting them from prosecution. ""j. edgar hoover crossed over the line and became a criminal himself,"" said vincent garo, mr. salvati's lawyer. ""he allowed a witness to lie to put an innocent man in prison so he could protect one of his informants."" mr. barboza was a crucial witness at trial against mr. salvati and may have implicated him because mr. salvati owed $400 to a loan shark who worked for mr. barboza. asked about the documents showing that mr. hoover knew of mr. salvati's innocence when he was put on trial, gail marcinkiewicz, a spokeswoman for the f.b.i. in boston, declined to comment, citing the pending litigation. a justice department task force is continuing to investigate misconduct in the boston office. in one of the first results of the investigation, one retired agent, john j. connolly, is awaiting sentencing next month after being convicted of racketeering and obstruction of justice for helping two other mob leaders who were f.b.i. informers, james bulger and stephen flemmi. vincent and stephen flemmi are brothers. the government reform committee, led by representative dan burton, republican of indiana, has uncovered memorandums from the boston office to headquarters in washington revealing the bureau's knowledge that vincent flemmi and mr. barboza were involved in killing mr. deegan. a memorandum a week after the killing described the crime, including who fired the first shot. then, on june 4, 1965, mr. hoover's office demanded to know what progress was being made in developing vincent flemmi as an informer. in a reply five days later, the special agent in charge of the boston office said that mr. flemmi was in a hospital recovering from gunshot wounds but because of his connections to mr. patriarca ""potentially could be an excellent informant."" the agent also informed mr. hoover that mr. flemmi was known to have killed seven men, ""and, from all indications, he is going to continue to commit murder."" nevertheless, the agent said, ""the informant's potential outweighs the risk involved."" a congressional investigator called the exchange chilling. ""the most frightening part is that after being warned about flemmi's murders, the director does not even respond,"" the investigator said. ""there is no message not to use a murderer as a government informant."" the origin of the corruption scandal was public and political pressure on mr. hoover to move more forcefully against the growing power of the mafia, which he had largely ignored. in boston, f.b.i. agents recruited mr. barboza and mr. flemmi and developed close ties to a rival criminal organization, the winter hill gang, led by mr. bulger. both sides got what they wanted, according to the investigations and the trial of mr. connolly. the f.b.i. got information that eventually helped destroy the patriarca and angiulo families, which controlled organized crime in new england. mr. bulger's gang was able to take over the rackets in boston, sell drugs and even commit murder while the f.b.i. looked the other way. one reason the f.b.i. may not have used its information about mr. patriarca's involvement in the deegan murder, congressional investigators say, is that it came from an illegal listening device in his providence, r.i., headquarters. the f.b.i. agent who transcribed the conversation made it appear that the information was coming from unnamed informants, to disguise the use of the device, the investigators say. mr. salvati, a former truck driver, now 69, had his sentence commuted in 1997 by gov. william f. weld. last year, while he was still on parole, his murder conviction was dismissed by a massachusetts state judge after the justice department task force made public documents suggesting his innocence. two of the other wrongly convicted men died in prison. their survivors have joined the fourth man, peter limone, in a $375 million lawsuit against the justice department. mr. limone was sentenced to die in the electric chair. his life was spared only when massachusetts outlawed the death penalty in 1974. mr. salvati lives in a modest apartment in boston's north end with his wife, marie, who visited him in prison every week during those 30 years. each week mr. salvati sent her a romantic card, which she put on the television set. it was, mr. garo said, all they had of each other. begin pgp signature version pgp 7.5 iqaawubpwmb2spxh8jf3ohaeql9qgcgxhq0ee06uesnv8u8wgvmjf9k7s4an3rb 3srsgomwjndwiakoehofnhpi oeld end pgp signature   r. a. hettinga mailto the internet bearer underwriting corporation  44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa ""... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, predicting the end of the world has not been found agreeable to experience.""  edward gibbon, 'decline and fall of the roman empire'",[],14022,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""applications still have to run zeroes and ones on some computing engine but the whole idea behind n1 is you stop thinking about that. you don't think about what box it is running on,"" sun vice president steve mackay, head of the n1 program, said in an interview on the sidelines of a sun user conference. many industry executives see computer power eventually being sold like power or water, as a utility that can be turned on or off, in whatever volume one wants whenever needed. for that to happen computers must be tied together seamlessly, rather than cobbling them together with tenuous links, as most networks do today, experts say. there are still major barriers, though, such as communications standards for machines from different vendors to interoperate closely. sun promised to deliver a ""virtualization engine"" that would let administrators look at their entire network as a pool by the end of the year. network administrators today often have no automatic system to report what is in the network. ""it'll tell you what you have and how it is laid out,"" promised mackay the second stage, beginning in 2003, would allow users to identify a service, such as online banking, and allocate resources for them with a few clicks, sun said. finally, in 2004, sun's software should allow networks to change uses of resources on the fly in response to changing needs, such as a bank assuring quicker online response time for priority users, the company said.",[],2497,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""in these challenging times, there can be no compromise in safeguarding corporate data and knowledge,"" says bernard hulme, chairman and ceo of endeavors technology. ""embedding rsa security encryption software into magi products provides it managers with added assurance, speed and cost savings, and a proven security net to accelerate the deployment of businesscentric peertopeer computing"" endeavors technology joins the rsa secured partner program. the program is designed to ensure complete interoperability between partner products and rsa security's solutions including rsa securid twofactor authentication, rsa cleartrust web access management, rsa bsafe encryption and rsa keon digital certificate management. the strategic partnership paves the way for magi enterprise to bear the rsa secured brand on product packaging and advertising, be listed in rsa secured partner solutions directories, and have rsa security's outofthebox, certified interoperability. it will also lead to joint marketing and promotional activities between the two firms, mutual field sales engagement opportunities on joint accounts, and 24x7 worldwide business continuity support. ""endeavors technology is taking a leadership role by providing the highestlevel of security in its enterprise products and streamlining the deployment process for it managers,"" says stuart cohen, director of partner development at rsa security. ""by combining our products, enterprise customers have a solution that provides encryption and authentication across firewalls."" about magi magi enterprise 3.0, an awardwinning web collaboration system, transforms today's web into a highly secure inter and intraenterprise collaboration network. for the first time, enterprises can implement adhoc virtual private networks for collaboration very rapidly and affordably without disrupting existing applications, networks or work practices. magi enterprise 3.0 does this by effectively transforming unsecured, ""readonly"" web networks into twoway trusted and transparent collaboration environments, through the use of such features as crossfirewall connections, advanced data extraction, an intuitive graphical interface, and universal name spaces generating ""follow me urls"" for mobile professionals. about rsa security, inc. rsa security inc., the most trusted name in esecurity, helps organizations build secure, trusted foundations for ebusiness through its rsa securid twofactor authentication, rsa cleartrust web access management, rsa bsafe encryption and rsa keon digital certificate management product families. with approximately one billion rsa bsafeenabled applications in use worldwide, more than ten million rsa securid authentication users and almost 20 years of industry experience, rsa security has the proven leadership and innovative technology to address the changing security needs of ebusiness and bring trust to the online economy. rsa security can be reached at about endeavors technology, inc. endeavors technology, inc. is a whollyowned subsidiary of mobile computing and network infrastructure vendor tadpole technology plc ( which has plants and offices in irvine and carlsbad (california), and cambridge, edinburgh, and bristol (uk). for further information on endeavors' p2p solutions, call 9498332800, email to or visit the company's website copyright 2002 endeavors technology, inc. magi, and magi enterprise are registered trademarks of endeavors technology, inc. rsa, bsafe, cleartrust, keon, securid, rsa secured and the most trusted name in esecurity are registered trademarks or trademarks of rsa security inc. in the united states andor other countries. all other products and services mentioned are trademarks of their respective companies.  2002 endeavors technology, inc., 19600 fairchild, suite 350, irvine, ca 92612, phone 9498332800, fax 9498332881, email all rights reserved specifications and descriptions subject to change without notice.",[],6586,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(ok, so we knew that already)  selling wedded bliss big business in thailand thu aug 29,1019 am et by andrew marshall bangkok, thailand (reuters)  english dentist ken moylan came to thailand looking for a wife. it took two hours to find her. ""the first day i went out with wan, she came back to my hotel and hung all my clothes up and tidied the room. i thought it was marvelous,"" he said. ""i knew then there was something special."" moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet  and marry  thai women. he lives in england now with 28yearold wan, who is expecting their first child. critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the west that often turn sour. but moylan says he has no regrets about coming to thailand in search of a wife. ""i got to thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. i'd met wan,"" he said. ""i knew i found her attractive. i could tell straight away that she was very caring."" moylan spent a week in thailand, and after returning to england kept in touch with wan by phone and mail. six months later she came to england and the couple married. mr. marriage lawrence lynch, 49, runs thai professional introduction services, the agency moylan used to meet his wife. lynch, who calls himself ""mr. marriage,"" started the company after also marrying a thai woman through an introduction agency. since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages. ""in the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""to the best of my knowledge, they have all been successful."" male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount. clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of thai women looking for a husband. if they like what they see they come to bangkok. clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in lynch's office  encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and language problems. ""we find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,"" lynch said. ""but once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax."" after the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know each other better. within two weeks of arrival, lynch says, almost every client has found a potential wife. ""at the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and think he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said. in most cases, marriage follows, usually within the next year. roongthip kamchat, managing director of thai no. 1 connections, a bangkokbased agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less than 10 percent have broken up. roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just arrived in bangkok looking for a wife. ""sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""and sometimes they are very impatient and say 'give me a lady, i want to get married now.' i say 'calm down, ok, we'll talk.""' but if men are really in a hurry, roongthip says, she can find them a wife and get them married within a week. lynch says clients he has found wives for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with posttraumatic stress disorder. why? similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. critics say they thrive on the neediness of lonely western men who are unable to form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the west. but moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is no reason to object. ""if you talk about people who are needy, i think everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, i need wan,"" he said. ""thai women are dissatisfied with life in thailand. i think there's no secret there. they are looking for a better life. i don't have a problem with that. in return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to their future husband."" lynch says men are dissatisfied with western women too, and that is why they choose to use his agency. his brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of defeminized, oversized, selfcentered, mercenaryminded lady available on the british singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are not ""god's gift to women."" roongthip said many western men found it difficult to meet women in their own countries  and found thai women attractive. ""they don't know how to meet women. even if they go to pubs or discotheques or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them? impossible,"" she said. ""many thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. they are good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. different from ladies from other countries."" although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap, the agencies say this is not a problem. they say language problems are also not a major obstacle. ""thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having a husband who is significantly older,"" lynch said. ""when i met my wife she couldn't speak a word of english. we muddled along with a phonetic dictionary. the ladies are very keen to learn english and they pick it up very quickly."" many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move to the west. ""we have kitchens, we have study classes,"" roongthip said. ""we teach them how to eat, and when to make tea."" pitfalls but not all dreams come true. ""bee"" is a 26yearold thai woman who went to switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. now she is back in bangkok, sad and angry. ""he had no friends, and i was so lonely,"" she said. ""i tried to make him happy but he just wanted sex and somebody to keep his house clean. he never spoke to me."" bee came back to bangkok earlier this year. ""i thought i would be happy there,"" she said. ""but it was the worst time of my life."" lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure unsuitable candidates are weeded out. ""we are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""we will not take on all comers."" moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the arrangement can work. wan's sister has just signed up with lynch's company, looking for a foreign husband. ""perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. i'm sure there are,"" moylan said. ""but in the majority of cases the women get a good deal.""",[],6969,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""in order to realise the full potential of web meetings, bestofbreed services are needed to eliminate time and geographical boundaries,"" says bernard hulme, tadpole's group chief executive. ""the powerful combination of endeavors' magi and webex's communications technologies will assist global work teams to better meet critical business goals and deadlines by maintaining teamwork momentum within and between web meetings."" ""webex is transforming the way businesses use the web for sales, marketing, training, support and product design,"" says david farrington, vice president of corporate development at webex communications.

(accelerating the ami and possibly openuae graphics is a necessity to meet for good speed in those environments, but an energyefficient gpu is a good sideeffect and portability (read battery lifetime) enabler.) 1.5 great control over cpu state by use of 'internet keys' wired to biosbhipset routines directly or preferably a scroll wheel. also, hibernate that works, please. 1.7 bootable to usb 2.0 drives (e.g. larger external ones) in bios, please. 2 p4 dells overheat. they have a big heatsink and a little fan to pull air through it, and if you don't elevate thelaptop off the desk or table or bed it's on, the fan will stay on. not good for mtbs (mean time between service unless you've got an angle on making money on service from amigans.....) one excellent solution is to include a heatpipe which runs behind the amlcd, thus using the backside of the display half as a radiator. though it interferes with the case notion below. (yes, aavid or such makes some as a standard part.) i prefer to include the heatpipe but employ the radiative mass in elevating the laptop (i.e. in the form of a catchhandle and second logo device behind the laptop, which generally provides stow and attachment for elevation legs (move them out farther to get to the nexthigher ekevation, until the sides of the laptop are met.) this also happens to provide a little protection for usb 2 and 1394 cables that i tend to keep plugged in all the time (a bit longer port life? please.) 3 a case color other than brown or black, and preferably (if the display module nre is entirely permissive) the capability to run with the backlight off. again, to save battery power, but also as a feature maybe you remember the ibooks modified in this manner. the user has the privilege to pull out the backlight diffuser and fiberoptic lightpipecf assembly, with its backreflector, and the whole warrantee. this provides for excellent outdoor use, often with the diffuser reinserted to keep depthoffield distractions minimised. what would i like? a1200 putty color, any translucency, in or over a rosewoodcolored (in kde color browser, i see chocolate, firebrick and a couple of 'indian red' that are great candidates) base. i would also like to be able to at least turn off the backlight without closing the lid, and to be able to fit an external light source such as a uvfiltered solar collector (and glare hood) to feed into the backlight. not only does this make an excellent color environment but lets one work outdoors tolerably. the logo should be a coloration of a minimal surface, as the maa is trying to get me to renew with demos at at first blush. we'll see what comes out of the contest and maybe you'll like the mapping mathcad does of the logo to a minimal surface or manifold that reflects the openness of amigaos, ami and amiga community. maa.org has more references, i'm sure. 4 obviously elfin details., e,g, the backlight inlet. other details usb2.x preferred firewire would be needed if that's unavailable. options like 802.11b or attabhable wifi hub for ethernet port should round out the offering. an option for justreleased .13 micron p4 (with mobile power features) could make more reviewers greenlight the series much better power consumption, and almost certainly a higher a top clock come with that. compactflash, smartmedia and mmc flash memory card interfaces would be very pleasant. i've mentioned booting to usb, and booting from cf would be a pleasant extigency also. to that end, a backup solution with compression using usb 2 storage or the multimode drive is always a nice bundle item that or a chance to back out a patch under 3 os..... blue skies (and clear water and fresh air) waterproof to 30 feet, 3 ethernet ports plus onboard wifi. svelte 3line frontpanel lcd and bright red pager led, builtin g4 cellphone functions, choice of side and frontpanel trim ivorylike stuff inscribed with m68k memory map and various os 3.9 structures or textured fur that says 'this is amiga speaking' when stroked 'round. decent keyboard, as in toshiba or ibm laptops perhaps an ergonomic fingerworks.com device (they work as keyboard and mouse) as the keyboardtrackpad. 2 directional planar mics atop amlcd soundcard with multiple 18 bit ad and noise reduction dsp that work in our (secondthroughfourth, at least) favorite os. actual 7"" bellows pulls out at nominal ventilation fan location for real voidcomp (the test in blade runner) style cooling and extended bass active cooling and airfiltering is available to adjust humidity at user seat and provide mineral water. hypertransport ports.",[],5493,0,0,easy_ham_testing

seen on the web. at first i thought it might be some sort of backstory to a rpg, but, nope, it looks like somebody believes this.  m09. dinosaurs eggs and the origins of good and evil. dinosaurs. reptoid ets are reported to be 12 foot high crocodiles walking on their hind legs. this is a description of a dinosaur. it now appears in remote viewing that the reptoid ets, dinosaurs and dragons are all linked together and that they all originated on earth. the erideans who are reptoid derivatives have a home planet (in the eridanus system) like all other ets. the reptoids have no reported home planet. they also come over as entities with little brain who control their bodies directly by spirit. this is a description of a ghost or disincarnate entity regardless of how people see them. thus it could be that the reptoids, erideans, nordics, anunnaki, but not the greys, all have origins on earth and have a strong link to earth even if they choose to live elsewhere. the greys do not appear to have a renal or urinary system and this points to them not originating on earth. the definitive work on dragons is ""the flight of dragons"" by peter dickinson. if dragons did exist in the flesh, they did not survive the long bow. targets do not come much bigger. truth is stranger than fiction. thus the writer's current scenario is that there were a race of dinosaurs which developed psychic intelligence to guard their eggs and young, and who probably preferred to live underground. they survived the wipe out of the dinosaurs 50 million years ago with difficulty. they evolved into the erideans and transferred to a more hospitable planet (for them) possibly with the help of another race of ets who wanted slaves but otherwise had no interest in earth or mind control. thus it appears that the current reptoids are the spirits or ghosts of the dinosaurs. they must have been powerful to survive 50 million years and also to appear to some people. they have appeared to the writer in remote viewing. they are living on as vampire entities. such immortal minds are contagious and can easily jump race and species barriers. if they can be encouraged to reincarnate, then the power sources of the black magicians and mind controllers will disappear. encouraging them to reincarnate will help so called immortal minds to disappear as immortal minds have great difficulty surviving reincarnation. purging people's dinosaurs should remove all perverse psychic abilities not under their control. they are a source of satanic guardian angels and demons. they control us by owning our psi. thus if we regain ownership of psi, we must relinquish their control and that of all other mind controllers. encourage people to regain ownership of their psi. the origins of love, hate and pure malice. the following scenario appears to hold water and can account for the origins of our universal subconscious. dinosaurs laid their eggs and buried them either underground or in piles of rotting vegetation (a good source of beetles and grubs for young hatchelings). they did not sit on their eggs to keep them warm, which made them very vulnerable to drastic climate and temperature change. in order to keep away predators some at least developed psychic mind control. to do this they had to capture ownership of the psi of potential predators. this is an act of hatred and outward looking. while a few dinosaurs did develop the ability to bear living young, most did not. the dinosaurs got in first and so their mind control tends to override all other latter minds. they have become the source of all satans, devils and demons. birds on the other hand developed the ability to sit on their eggs and keep them warm. a hen bird normally lays a series of eggs (say one per day) and only starts sitting when the clutch is completely laid. thus all eggs tend to hatch together as they all have an equal period of warmth. this is primarily an act of love but inward looking. bearing live young is not suitable to a bird of the air. a pregnant pigeon would not fly very far. antarctic penguins tuck a single egg between their legs to keep it warm, even if they are standing on ice. mammals developed live bearing of their young which is also primarily an act of love and inward looking. this is especially true as a mammalian female can not desert her young in the womb in case of emergency as can a bird sitting on a nest. dinosaurs developed hate and mind control of others to protect their young, while birds and mammals developed love. birds and mammals certainly do hate all enemies of their young, but this is secondary. if one wants to purge the sources of malice of say a black magician, then purge his dinosaurs and his dinosaur eggs. unfortunately most of our religions are based on dinosaur protection of eggs and thus mind control, regardless of the front they put out to the public. religion tends to concentrate on ""how to brainwash your neighbour"". conscious thought has built many mighty empires, theologies and slave control systems out of using ""how to care for and protect one's young"" as a foundation. thus the foulest form of abuse possible is to call something ""a load of dinosaur's eggs"". purging the dinosaurs and dinosaur's eggs of any entity tends to purge all malice back to its roots. it looks as if mighty immortal minds have built up from small beginnings, aided and abetted by various occultists and other. as they will insist on vampiring the living for energy to avoid reincarnation and disturbing the serenity of the writer, he encourages them to reincarnate. items for inspection. for mind control to take place, then someone must take control or ownership of the target's psi and pleasure centres. check for the following. nest of dinosaur's eggs, holy dinosaurs, etc. eggs, controllers or owners in peoples psi, pleasure centres, pain killing hormones, abilities, etc. mind machines. the original engraving or engram. god and satan appear to be job titles and not entities in their own right. t hey appear to be dinosaur engravings or engrams. no doubt dinosaurs were the first job holders. timetracks are worth investigating as our complete history from the start of time. my, our, man's timetracks, etc. the time tracks of the universe, universal subconscious, galactic subconscious, etc. extinct races of ets can cause problems when they live on in vampire mode. their virtues may known to channelers but they can also have vices. whenever one hears of races which have evolved on to higher planes, suspect that the higher plane is a vampire one. one may never know what they looked like or other basic characteristics, which makes linking back a trifle difficult. every extinct race, etc. blood ancestors are also

(currently xreject is retained in saved messages.) if a message was not tagged with xreject, then localscan.py runs the usual virus and spam checks. (namely, my homebrew scan for attachments with filenames that look like windows executables, and a run through spamassassin.) the logic is basically this if virus folder  ""virus"" else run through spamassassin if score  10.0 folder  ""rejectedspam"" elif score  5.0 folder  ""caughtspam"" finally, localscan.py writes the message to the designated folder. by far the biggest folder will be ""accepted""  the server handles 20005000 incoming messages per day, of which maybe 100500 are junk mail. (oops, just realized i haven't written the code that actually saves the message  d'ohh! also haven't written anything to discriminate personal email, which i must do. sigh.)  finally, the big catch waiting until after you've read the message headers and body to actually reject the message is problematic, because certain broken mtas (including those used by some spammers) don't consider a 5xx after data as a permanent error, but keep retrying. d'ohh. this is a minor annoyance currently, where a fair amount of stuff is rejected at rcpt to time. but in harvest mode, everything (with the exception of people probing for open relays) will be rejected at data time. so i have cooked up something called the asbl, or automated sender blacklist. this is just a berkeley db file that maps (senderip, senderaddress) to an expiry time. when localscan() rejects a message from (senderip, senderaddress)  for whatever reason, including finding an xreject header added by an acl in exim4.conf  it adds a record to the asbl, with an expiry time 3 hours in the future. meanwhile, there's an acl in exim4.conf that checks for records in the asbl if there's a record for the current (senderip, senderaddress) that hasn't expired yet, we reject all recipients without ever looking at the message headers or body. the downside of this from the pointofview of corpus collection is that if some jerk is busily spamming one smtp connection per address, we will most likely only get one copy. this is a win if you're just thinking about reducing server load and bandwidth, but i'm not sure if it's helpful for training spam detectors. tim? happy harvesting  greg  greg ward budget's in the red? let's tax religion!  dead kennedys",[],4988,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""i've heard everything from no change to modest decline to more dramatic declines,"" said clavez, who will become the dean of science and engineering at princeton university in january. ""it can be hard to see this, because at some colleges the number of people who want to study computer science so far exceeds the available space. but it is going to have an effect."" at virginia tech, enrollment of undergraduates in the computer science department will drop 25 percent this year, to 300. at george washington university, the number of incoming freshmen who plan to study computer science fell by more than half this year. interest in undergraduate computer science programs had grown rapidly in the past decade. in 1997, schools with phd programs in computer science and computer engineering granted 8,063 degrees, according to the computing research association. the numbers rose through 2001, when 17,048 degrees were awarded. the labor department projects that software engineering will be the fastestgrowing occupation between 2000 and 2010, with other computerrelated industries trailing close behind. but in the short term that growth may slow, based on the changes among college students. for example, 900 of the 2,000plus undergraduates studying information technology and engineering at george mason university were computer science majors last year. this year the enrollment in that major is down to 800, although a newly created and more general information technology major has attracted 200 students. ""having it ease off for a while is a bit of a relief,"" said lloyd griffith, dean of george mason's information technology and engineering school. ""particularly with the field as it has been, they don't want to spend four years on something and then not get a job."" freshman enrollment for the university of maryland's computer science major is expected to be about 167 this fall, down from 329 last year. maryland decreased its total freshman enrollment by 11 percent, but that alone does not account for the drop, said steve halperin, dean of maryland's college of computer, mathematical and physical sciences. ""we are seeing a decrease in the number of freshmen who are declaring their interest in pursuing computer science as a major,"" halperin said. ""that's a factual statement. but i would say that at this point . . . we don't expect to see a decrease in the number of graduates. many of the kids who are no longer expressing an interest in majoring in cs would have fallen off."" yandziak, who began at the university of virginia on saturday, is not convinced that's the case. he graduated in the top 5 percent of his class, with a 3.9 gradepoint average, and nailed the highest possible score on his advancedplacement exam in computer science. ""all of my classes have been easy for me. math and sciences were always fun, so i looked for professions in which i could use those things,"" yandziak said. ""i'm just not sure i want my life to be immersed in technology. i want to do something that will contribute to the practical world."" harris n. miller, president of the information technology association of america, said the last time there was a dearth of computing professionals, salaries skyrocketed and workers benefited from the labor shortage. ""there was a tremendous imbalance in the late '90s potentially you have the same sort of thing going on right now. people are saying, 'i don't need this kind of it training right now,' "" miller said. ""our concern as an industry is that if they begin to again see major declines in enrollment, down the road four years, as the economy picks up, once again companies are going to find themselves in a shortage situation."" economic potential weighs heavily in many student career choices, but other factors, including program difficulty, personal interests and social influences, also come into play, said judy hingle, director of professional development at the american college counseling association. the perception of computer science as an isolating, ""nerdy"" profession is one that many in the industry have tried to squelch. that stereotype went underground during the tech bubble but reemerged during the bust. ""all the hipness is gone,"" yandziak said. ""once we thought of the internet as this thing with infinite capabilities. it was basically just a fad that came along."" lamont thompson, a recent graduate of calvin coolidge senior high school in the district, is headed to morehouse college in atlanta to study business marketing, with the intention of going into real estate development. ""technology comes natural to people my age it's not fascinating anymore,"" thompson said.

""ladies and gentlemen, this is a difficult moment for america, he said in the speech. today, weve had a national tragedy. it was 930 a.m. as he spoke, mr. bush didnt know that two more hijacked jets were streaking toward washington. vice pesident dick cheney was in his office at the white house when a secret service agent ran in. he said to me, sir, we have to leave immediately and grabbed, put a hand on my belt, another hand on my shoulder and propelled me out the door of my office, cheney recalls. im not sure how they do it, but they sort of levitate you down the hallway, you move very fast. there wasnt a lot of time for chitchat, you know, with the vice president, says secret service director brian stafford, who was in his command center ordering the roundup of top officials and the first family. he felt that he had only minutes to work with. we knew there were unidentified planes tracking in our direction, he says. cheney was rushed deep under the white house into a bunker called the presidential emergency operations center. it was built for war, and this was it. on her way down, national security advisor condoleezza rice called mr. bush. it was brief because i was being pushed to get off the phone and get out of the west wing, says rice. they were hurrying me off the phone with the president and i just said, he said, im coming back and we said mr. president that may not be wise. i remember stopping briefly to call my family, my aunt and uncle in alabama and say, im fine. you have to tell everybody that im fine but then settling into trying to deal with the enormity of that moment, and in the first few hours, i think the thing that was on everybodys mind was how many more planes are coming. the capitol was evacuated. and for the first time ever, the secret service executed the emergency plan to ensure the presidential line of succession. agents swept up the 15 officials who stood to become president if the others were killed. they wanted to move vice president cheney, fearing he was in danger even in the bunker. but cheney says when he heard the other officials were safe, he decided to stay at the white house, no matter what. its important to emphasize it's not personal, you dont think of it in personal terms, youve got a professional job to do, says cheney. cheney was joined by transportation secretary norm mineta who remembers hearing the faa counting down the hijacked jets closing in on the capital. says mineta someone came in and said mr. vice president theres a plane 50 miles out, then he came in and said its now 10 miles out, we dont know where it is exactly, but its coming in low and fast. it was american flight 77. at 938 a.m., it exploded into the pentagon, the first successful attack on washington since the war of 1812. as the pentagon burned, mr. bushs limousine sped toward air force one in florida. at that moment, united flight 93  the last hijacked plane  was taking dead aim at washington. at the white house, the staff was in the west wing cafeteria, watching on tv. press secretary jennifer millerwise was in the crowd when the order came to evacuate. i no sooner walked outside when someone from the secret service yelled women drop your heels and run, drop your heels and run, and suddenly the gates that never open except for authorized vehicles just opened and the whole white house just flooded out, she recalls. in florida, as mr. bush boarded air force one, he was overheard telling a secret service agent be sure to get the first lady and my daughters protected. at 957 a.m., air force one thundered down the runway, blasting smoke and dust in a full hrust take off. communications director dan bartlett was on board. it was like a rocket, he remembers. for a good ten minutes, the plane was going almost straight up. at the same moment, 56 minutes after it was hit, world trade center tower two began to falter, then cascade in an incomprehensible avalanche of steel, concrete and human lives. someone said to me, look at that i remember that, look at that and i looked up and i saw and i just remember a cloud of dust and smoke and the horror of that moment, recalls rice of the tv newscast. she also felt something in her gut that weve lost a lot of americans and that eventually we would get these people. i felt the anger. of course i felt the anger. down in the bunker, cheney was trying to figure out how many hijacked planes there were. officials feared there could be as many as 11. as the planes track toward washington, a discussion begins about whether to shoot them down. i discussed it with the president, cheney recalls. are we prepared to order our aircraft to shoot down these airliners that have been hijacked? he said yes. it was my advice. it was his decision, says cheney. thats a sobering moment to order your own combat aircraft to shoot down your own civilian aircraft, says bush. but it was an easy decision to make given the  given the fact that we had learned that a commercial aircraft was being used as a weapon. i say easy decision, it was, i didnt hesitate, let me put it that way. i knew what had to be done. the passengers on united flight 93 also knew what had to be done. they fought for control and sacrificed themselves in a pennsylvania meadow. the flight was 15 minutes from washington. clearly, the terrorists were trying to take out as many symbols of government as they could the pentagon, perhaps the capitol, perhaps the white house. these people saved us not only physically but they saved us psychologically and symbolically in a very important way, too, says rice. meanwhile, tower one was weakening. it had stood for an hour and 43 minutes. at 1029 a.m., it buckled in a mirror image of the collapse of its twin. the image that went round the world reached the first lady in a secure location somewhere in washington. i was horrified, she says. i thought, dear god, protect as many citizens as you can. it was a nightmare. by 1030 a.m., americas largest city was devastated, its military headquarters were burning. air force one turned west along the gulf coast. i can remember sitting right here in this office thinking about the consequences of what had taken place and realizing it was the defining moment in the history of the united states, says president bush. i didnt need any legal briefs, i didnt need any consultations, i knew we were at war. mr. bush says the first hours were frustrating. he watched the horrifying pictures, but the tv signal was breaking up. his calls to cheney were cutting out. mr. bush says he pounded his desk shouting, this is inexcusable get me the vice president. i was trying to clear the fog of war, and there is a fog of war, says the president. ""information was just flying from all directions. chief of staff card brought in the reports. there was word camp david had been hit. a jet was thought to be targeting mr. bushs ranch. i remember hearing that the state department might have been hit, or that the white house had a fire in it. so we were hearing lots of different information, says card. they also feared that air force one itself was a target. cheney told the president there was a credible threat against the plane. using the code name for air force one, mr. bush told an aide, angel is next. the threat was passed to presidential pilot colonel mark tillman. it was serious before that but now it is no longer is it a time to get the president home, tillman says. we actually have to consider everything we say, everything we do could be intercepted, and we have to make sure that no one knows what our position is. tillman asked for an armed guard at his cockpit door while secret service agents doublechecked the identity of everyone on board. the crew reviewed the emergency evacuation plan. then came a warning from air traffic control  a suspect airliner was dead ahead. coming out of sarasota there was one call that said there was an airliner off our nose that they did not have contact with, tillman remembers. tillman took evasive action, pulling his plane high above normal traffic. they were on course for washington, but by now no one thought that was a good idea, except the president. i wanted to come back to washington, but the circumstances were such that it was just impossible for the secret service or the national security team to clear the way for air force one to come back, says bush. so air force one set course for an underground command center in nebraska. back in washington, the presidents closest advisor, karen hughes, heard about the threat to the plane and placed a call to mr. bush. and the military operator came back to me and in a voice that, to me, sounded very shaken said, maam, im sorry, we cant reach air force one. hughes recalls. hughes was out of the white house during the attacks. when she came back, it was a place she didnt recognize. there were either military, or maybe secret service, dressed all in black, holding machine guns as, as we drove up. and i never expected to see something like that in, in our nation's capital, says hughes. when she walked into the white house, no one was inside. i knew it was a day that you didn't want to surprise anybody, and so i yelled, hello? and two, again, kind of swat team members came running, running through the, the hall with, again, guns drawn, and then took me to, to the location where i met the vice president. on air force one, col. tillman had a problem. he needed to hide the most visible plane in the world, a 747 longer than the white house itself. he didnt want to use his radio, because the hijackers could be listening to air traffic control. so he called air traffic control on the telephone. we actually didn't tell them our destination or what directions we were heading, says tillman. we, we basically just talked to 'em and said, 'ok, fine, we have no clearance at this time, we are just going to fly across the united states.' controllers passed air force one from one sector to another, warning each other to keep the route secret. ok, wheres he going? one tower radioed to another. just watch him, a second tower responded. dont question him wheres he's going. just work him and watch him, theres no flight plan in and were not going to put anything in. ok, sir? air force one ordered a fighter escort, and air traffic control radioed back air force one, got two f16s at about your 10 oclock position. the staff, and the president and us, were filed out along the outside hallway of his presidential cabin there and looking out the windows, says bartlett. and the president gives them a signal of salute, and the pilot kind of tips his wing, and fades off and backs into formation. the men in the f16s were shane brotherton and randy roberts, from the texas air national guard. their mission was so secret their commander wouldnt tell them where they were going. he just said, 'youll know when you see it,' and that was my first clue, i didnt have any idea what we were going up until that point, says brotherton. he knew when he saw it. we, we were trying to keep an 80mile bubble, bubble around air force one, and we'd investigate anything that was within 80 miles, says roberts. bush says he was not worried about the safety of the people on this aircraft, or for his own safety i looked out the airplane and saw two f16s on each wing. it was going to have to be a pretty good pilot to get us. we now know that the threat to air force one was part of the fog of war, a false alarm. but it had a powerful effect at the time. some wondered, with the president out of sight, was he still running the government? he hadnt appeared after the attack on washington. mr. bush was clearly worried about it. at one point he was overheard saying, the american people want to know where their dang president is. the staff considered an address to the nation by phone but instead mr. bush ordered air force one to land somewhere within 30 minutes so he could appear on tv. at 1145 a.m., they landed at barksdale air force base in louisiana. the resolve of our great nation is being tested. but make no mistake, we will show the world that we will pass this test. god bless, bush said to the nation from barksdale. at barksdale, the secret service believed the situation in washington was still unsafe. so the plane continued on to nebraska, to the command center where mr. bush would be secure and have all the communications gear he needed to run the government. aboard air force one, mr. bush had a job for press secretary fleischer. the president asked me to make sure that i took down everything that was said. i think he wanted to make certain that a record existed, says fleischer fleischers notes capture mr. bushs language, plain and unguarded. to the vice president he said were at war, dick, were going to find out who did this and kick their ass. another time, mr. bush said, were not going to have any slaponthewrist crap this time. the president adds, i can remember telling the secretary of defense, i said, were going to find out who did this and then mr. secretary, you and dick myers, who we just named as chairman of the joint chiefs, are going to go get them. by 3 p.m., air force one touched down at offutt air force base in nebraska. mr. bush and his team were herded into a small brick hut that gave no hint of what they would find below. at the bottom of the stairs was the u.s. strategic command underground command center. it was built to transmit a presidents order to go to nuclear war. but when mr. bush walked in, the battle staff was watching the skies over the united states. many airplanes had still not landed. after a short briefing, mr. bush and card were taken to a teleconference center which connected them to the white house, the pentagon, the fbi and the cia. mr. bush had a question for his cia director george tenent. according to rice, bush asked tenent who had done this. rice recalls that tenent answered sir, i believe its al qaeda. were doing the assessment but it looks like, it feels like, it smells like al qaeda. the evidence would build. fbi director robert mueller says that an essential clue came from one of the hijacked planes before it crashed. a flight attendant on american flight 11, amy sweeney, had the presence of mind to call her office as the plane was hijacked and give them the seat numbers of the hijackers. that was the first piece of hard evidence. we could then go to the manifest, find out who was sitting in those seats and immediately conduct an investigation of those individuals, as opposed to taking all the passengers on the plane and going through a process of elimination, says mueller. in nebraska, the white house staff was preparing for an address to the nation from the air force bunker, but by then the president had had enough. he decided to come back. at one point, he said he didnt want any tinhorn terrorist keeping him out of washington, fleischer says. that verbatim. on board, he was already thinking of issuing an ultimatum to the world i had time to think and a couple of thoughts emerged. one was that you're guilty if you harbor a terrorist, because i knew these terrorists like alqaeda liked to prey on weak government and weak people. the other thought that came was the opportunity to fashion a vast coalition of countries that would either be with us or with the terrorists. as air force one sped east, the last casualty of the attack on america collapsed, one of the nations worst days wore into evening. at the world trade center, 2,801 were killed at the pentagon, 184 and in pennsylvania 40. altogether, there were 3,025 dead. anybody who would attack america the way they did, anybody who would take innocent life the way they did, anybody who's so devious, is evil, bush said recently. mr. bush would soon see that evil face to face. after arriving in washington, he boarded his helicopter and flew past the pentagon on the way to the white house. was there a time when he was afraid that there might not be a white house to return to? i dont remember thinking about whether or not the white house would have been obliterated,"" he recalls. ""i think i might have thought they took their best shot, and now it was time for us to take our best shot. mr. bush arrived back at the white house nine hours after the attacks. his next step was an address to the nation. karen hughes and her staff were already working on the speech. he decided that the primary tone he wanted to strike that night was reassurance, remembers hughes. we had to show resolve, we had to reassure people, we had to let them know that we would be ok. just off the oval office, mr. bush added the words that would become known as the bush doctrine  no distinction between terrorists and those who harbor them. the staff wanted to add a declaration of war but mr. bush didnt think the american people wanted to hear it that night and he was emphatic about that. he prepared to say it from the same desk where franklin roosevelt first heard the news of pearl harbor. now bush was commander in chief. eighty million americans were watching. today our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts, he said from the oval office that night. the oval office speech came at the end of the bloodiest day in american history since the civil war. before he walked to the white house residence for the night, mr. bush dictated these words for the white house daily log the pearl harbor of the 21st century took place today. we think it's osama bin laden. (cbs) when sept. 12 dawned, president bush was demanding a war plan. no one in the white house or the pentagon could be sure of what the president would do. in office for just eight months, hed never been tested as commanderinchief. i never asked them what they thought, president bush said of the pentagon brass, because i didnt really  because i knew what i was gonna do. i knew exactly what had to be done, scott. and that was to set a strategy to seek justice. find out who did it, hunt them down and bring them to justice. in the cabinet room, the president made clear what was next the deliberate and deadly attacks which were carried out yesterday against our country were more than acts of terror, they were acts of war, he said. to the war cabinet, al qaeda was no surprise. national security advisor condoleezza rice says the administration had been at work on a plan to strike bin ladens organization well before sept. 11. the president said, you know im tired of swatting at flies, i need a strategy to eliminate these guys, rice recalls. in one of the worst intelligence failures ever, the cia and fbi didnt pick up clues that an attack in the united states was imminent. without a sense of urgency, the white house strategy the president had asked for came too late. chief of staff andrew card recalls that the plan mr. bush had asked for was literally headed to the presidents desk, i think, on the eleventh, tenth or eleventh, of september. on sept. 12, the war cabinet was debating the full range of options  who to hit and how to hit them. there were some at the pentagon who worried in the early hours that mr. bush would order up an immediate cruise missile strike, of the kind that had not deterred bin laden in the past. well, theres a lot of nervous nellies at the pentagon, anyway, mr. bush tells pelley. a lot of people like to chatter, you know, more than they should. but no, i appreciate that very much. secretary of defense (donald) rumsfeld early on discussed the idea of making sure we had what we called boots on the ground. that if youre gonna go to war, then youve gotta go to war with all your assets. the president says he wanted to fight and win a guerilla war with conventional means. it was an innovative but risky idea being proposed by cia director george tenent. tenent wanted to combine american technology and intelligence with the brute force of afghan fighters hostile to the taliban government. secretary of state colin powell, noting that the cia had already developed a long relationship with the afghan resistance, called it an unconventional solution to an unconventional problem. as i like to describe it to my friends, powell says, we had on the ground a fourth world army riding horses and living in tents with some cia and special forces with them and we had a first world air force, the best in the world. how do you connect it all? the president gave them 48 hours to figure it out. meanwhile, mr. bush went to the battlefield himself. just the day before, he had called the pentagon the mightiest building in the world. now onefifth of it was in ruins. the wreckage of american flight 77 was being examined by navy investigators. and before mr. bush left, he made a point of speaking personally with the team recovering the remains of the first casualties of war on his watch. the next day, sept. 13, there was another warning of attack that the public never heard about. threats had been were coming in constantly but this one sounded credible a large truck bomb headed to the white house. the secret service wanted the president back in the bunker. he wasnt real receptive to that, to that recommendation, remembers brian stafford, director of the secret service. and he ordered a hamburger and said he was going to stay in the white house that evening and thats what he did. the next day, would be one of the longest and the most difficult for the president. on friday, sept. 14, mr. bush started the day with a cabinet meeting, but he wept when he walked in and was surprised by applause. he sat down, slightly overcome, for a moment but he recaptured it, says powell who remembers being worried that the president might have trouble getting through his speech at the national memorial service later that morning. and i just scribbled a little note to him, powell recalls, and i said, mr. president, ive learned over the years when you are going to give a very emotional speech, watch out for certain words that will cause you to start to tear up. he looked at me and he smiled and then at the next break in the conversation he said, the secretary of state told me not to break down at the memorial service, and that broke the tension and everybody started laughing and i felt embarrassed. first lady laura bush was involved in planning the memorial service and she says she wanted it to be both dignified and comforting. i wanted the psalms and everything to be read to be comforting, because i think we were a country, that needed, everyone of us, needed comforting. it also stirred the mourners resolve, as rice remember. as we stood to sing the battle hymn of the republic, she says, you could feel the entire congregation and i could certainly feel myself stiffen, the kind of spine, and this deep sadness was being replaced by resolve. we all felt that we still had mourning to do for our countrymen who had been lost but that we also had a new purpose in not just avenging what had happened to them but making certain that the world was eventually going to be safe from this kind of attack ever again. next came a visit to ground zero. the president was not prepared for what he encountered there. you couldnt brief me, you couldnt brief anybody on ground zero until you saw it,"" mr. bush says. it was like  it was ghostly. like youre having a bad dream and youre walking through the dream. the president found the scene very powerful, particularly when the men and women at ground zero began to chant, usa! usa!. there was a lot of bloodlust, the president recalls. people were, you know, pointing their big old hands at me saying, dont you ever forget this, mr. president. dont let us down. the scene was very powerful. very powerful. when mr. bush tried to speak, the crowd kept shouting, we cant hear you. the president responded, i can hear you. i can hear you. the rest of the world hears you. and the people who knocked these buildings down will hear all of us soon. mr. bush had been in new york just a few weeks before hed posed with the firemen who always stood by whenever the presidents helicopter landed there. now, five of the men who stood with the president in the picture were dead  lost at ground zero. when the president arrived sept. 14, manhattan was papered with the faces of the lost. families, unable to believe that so many had vanished in an instant, held onto the hope that their loved ones were just missing. it was a place where a child comforted a grieving mother. at a meeting the public never saw, the president spoke with several hundred of these families in a convention hall. people said to me, hell come out. dont worry, mr. president, well see him soon. i know my loved one, he will  hell find a place to survive underneath the rubble and well get him out. i, on the other hand had been briefed about the realities, and my job was to hug and cry, but i remember the whole time thinking, this is incredibly sad because the loved ones wont come out. one little boy handed the president a picture of his father in his firefighter uniform and as he signed it, mr. bush remembers, he told the boy, your daddy wont believe that i was here, so you show him that autograph. it was an effort to provide a little hope, the president recalls. i still get emotional thinking about it because were dealing with people who loved their dads or loved their mom, or loved their...wives who loved their husbands. it was a tough time, you know, it was a tough time for all of us because we were a very emotional, and i was emotional at times. i felt, i felt the same now as i did then, which is sad. and i still feel sad for those who grieve for their families, but through my tears, i see opportunity. the president was supposed to be with the families for about 30 minutes he stayed for two and a half hours. it was there he met arlene howard. the body of her son, george, was among the first to be found at ground zero. i called the police department, howard remembers,  and they said he hadnt called in for roll call and to call back in an hour and i said, no, i dont need to call back. if he hadnt called in, i knew where he was. george howard had rescued children trapped in an elevator back in 1993 when the world trade center was bombed. he had been off duty that day, and he was off duty on sept. 11, but couldnt stay away. the police department gave his badge to his mother and she gave it to the president. he (the president) he leaned over to talk to me, howard recalls. and he extends his sympathy to me and thats when i asked him id like to present georges shield to him in honor of all the men and women who were killed over there. by the end of that day, mr. bush flew to camp david visibly drained. he was physically exhausted, he was mentally exhausted, he was emotionally exhausted, he was spiritually exhausted, recalls card.. the next day  saturday, sept. 15  mr. bush met members of his war cabinet at the presidential retreat for a last decisive meeting. my message is for everybody who wears the uniform  get ready. the united states will do what it takes, mr. bush told them. as powell remembers it, he was encouraging us to think boldly. he was listening to all ideas he was not constrained to any one idea he wanted to hear his advisors talk and argue and debate with each other. president bush was pleased with the progress that had been made. on the other hand, he says, i wanted to clarify plans and i went around the room and i asked everybody what they thought ought to happen. when he left that meeting on saturday night, he still had not told the cabinet what he was planning. i wanted to just think it through, mr. bush remembers. any time you commit troops to harms way, a president must make sure that he fully understands all the consequences and ramifications. and i wanted to just spend some time on it alone. and did. what were his reservations? mr. bush says, could we win? i didnt want to be putting our troops in there unless i was certain we could win. and i was certain we could win. nine days after the attacks on america, before a joint session of congress the president committed the nation to the war on terror. each of us will remember what happened that day and to whom it happened, mr. bush told the congress and the nation. well remember the moment the news came, where we were and what we were doing. some will remember an image of a fire or a story of rescue. some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever. and i will carry this. it is the police shield of a man named george howard, who died at the world trade center trying to save others. it was given to me by his mom, arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. it is my reminder of lives that ended and a task that does not end. a year has passed since then, but the president says his job is still to remind americans of what happened and of the war that is still being waged, a war he reminds himself of every day in the oval office, literally keeping score, one terrorist at a time. in his desk, the president says, i have a classified document that might have some pictures on there, just to keep reminding me about whos out there, where they might be and as the terrorists are captures or killed? i might make a little check there, yeah, mr. bush admits. but there is no check by the name that must be on the top of that list  osama bin laden. (cbs) a lot has happened in the year since sept. 11. one year ago, the president was new on the job, with little experience in foreign policy. he had wanted to pull the military back from foreign entanglements. now, on his orders, u.s. forces are engaged around the globe in a war he did not expect, in a world completely changed. in the oval office last week, cbs news correspondent scott pelley asked the president about iraq, about whether americans are safe at home and about osama bin laden.  scott pelley you must be frustrated, maybe angry. after a year, we still dont have osama bin laden? president bush how do you know that? i dont know whether osama bin laden is dead or alive. i dont know that. hes not leading a lot of parades. and hes not nearly the hero that a lot of people thought he was. this is much bigger than one person anyway. this is  were slowly but surely dismantling and disrupting the al qaeda network that, that hates america. and we will stay on task until we complete the task. i always knew this was a different kind of war, scott. see, in the old days, you measure the size and the strength of the enemy by counting his tanks or his airplanes and his ships. this is an international manhunt. were after these people one at the time. theyre killers. period. pelley but have you won the war before you find osama bin laden dead or alive? mr. bush if he were dead, theres somebody else to replace him. and we would find that person. but slowly but surely, we will dismantle the al qaeda network. and those who sponsor them and those who harbor them. and at the same time, hopefully lay the seeds for, the conditions necessary so that people dont feel like theyve got to conduct terror to achieve objectives. pelley do you look back on the afghan campaign with any doubts? certainly, weve overthrown the taliban government. certainly, al qaeda has been scattered. but some of the taliban leaders appear to have gotten away. and there have been many civilian casualties as well. mr. bush uh huh. well, you know, i am sad that civilians lost their life. but i understand war. we did everything we can to  everything we could to protect people. when civilians did die, it was because of a mistake. certainly not because of intention. we liberated a country for which im extremely proud. no,  i dont second guess things. its  things never go perfect in a time of war. pelley are you committed to ending the rule of saddam hussein? mr. bush im committed to regime change. pelley there are those who have been vocal in their advice against war in iraq. some of our allies in the gulf war, saudi arabia, turkey for example. even your fathers former national security advisor, mr. scowcroft has written about it in the paper. what is it in your estimation that they dont understand about the iraq question that you do appreciate? mr. bush the policy of the government is regime change, scott, hasnt changed. i get all kinds of advice. im listening to the advice. i appreciate the consultations. and well consult with a lot of people but our policy hasnt changed. pelley on air force one you described the terrorists as evil. mr. bush yeah. pelley i dont think anyone would disagree with that, but at the same time, many in the arab world are angry at the united states for political reasons because of our policy in israel or our troops in the oil region of the middle east. is there any change in foreign policy that youre considering that might reduce arab anger against the united states. mr. bush hmm. well, im working for peace in the middle east. im the first president that ever went to the united nations and publicly declared the need to have a palestinian state living sidebyside with israel in peace. ive made it clear that in order for there to be peace the palestinians have gotta to get some leadership that renounces terror and believes in peaces and quits using the palestinian people as pawns. i've also made it clear to the other arab nations in the region that theyve got responsibilities. if you want peace they gotta work toward it. were more than willing to work for it, but they have to work for it as well. but all this business isnt going to happen as long as a few are willing to blow up the hopes of many. so we all gotta work to fight off terror. pelley arafat has to go? mr. bush either, hes, hes been a complete failure as far as i am concerned. utter disappointment. pelley there has been some concern over the year about civil liberties. mr. bush yeah... pelley in fact, an appeals court recently was harsh about your administrations decision to close certain deportation hearings. they said, quote, a government operating in secrecy stands in opposition to the constitution. where do you draw the line sir? mr. bush i draw the line at the constitution. we will protect america. but we will do so on, within the guidelines of the constitution, confines of the constitution, spirit of the constitution. pelley is there anything that the justice department has brought to you as an idea that youve thought, no, thats too far. i dont wanna go..."" mr. bush nah, not that that i remember. and i am pleased with the justice department. i think that attorney generals doing a fine job, by the way...and to the extent that our courts are willing to make sure that they review decisions we make, i think thats fine. i mean, thats good. its healthy. its part of america. pelley franklin roosevelt said that america should stand in defense of four freedoms. freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom from want and freedom from fear. do we have that today mr. president? freedom from fear? mr. bush i think more than we did, in retrospect. the fact that we are on alert, the fact that we understand the new circumstances makes us more free from fear than on that fateful day of september the 11th. weve got more work to do. pelley and americans should not live their lives in fear? mr. bush i dont think so. no. i think americans oughta know their governments doing everything possible to help. and obviously if we get information that relates directly a particular attack well deal with it. and if we get noise that deals with a general attack, well alert people. there are a lot of good folks working hard to disrupt and deny and run down leads. and the american people need to go about their lives. it seems like they are.",[],40657,0,0,easy_ham_testing

yorkers observed the solemn anniversary of the horrific events that befell our city on sept. 11, 2001. all of those who perished must never be forgotten. the footprints of the fallen twin towers and a portion of the 16acre site must be dedicated to a memorial and civic amenities that recall the sacrifices that were made there and the anguish that those senseless acts of terror created for the victims' families and, indeed, for all of us. but for the good of the city and the region, the 10millionplus square feet of commercial and retail space that was destroyed with the twin towers must be replaced on the site. about 50,000 people worked in the world trade center. those jobs are lost, along with those of another 50,000 people who worked in the vicinity. together, those jobs in lower manhattan, for which the trade center was the economic stimulus, produced annual gross wages of about $47 billion, or 15% of the annual gross wages earned in the entire state. some of the firms have relocated elsewhere in the city and region, but many have not. new york city is facing a budget deficit. without additional jobs, the deficit may become permanent. this is one reason for the importance of rebuilding. if we do not replace the lost space, lower manhattan never will regain the vibrancy it had as the world's financial center. love them or hate them, and there were lots of new yorkers on both sides of the issue, the towers made a powerful statement to the world that said, ""this is new york, a symbol of our free economy and of our way of life."" that is why they were destroyed. this is a second reason why the towers must be replaced, and with buildings that make a potent architectural statement. in recent weeks, redevelopment proposals have been circulated from many sources. most of these focus not on the trade center site, however, but on all of lower manhattan. further, many believe that the 10 million square feet either could be located elsewhere, scattered in several sites, or simply never rebuilt. these proposals miss the point. what was destroyed, and what must be recovered, was the trade center, not all of lower manhattan. except over the towers' footprints, where there must be no commercial development, the office and retail space lost has to be rebuilt on or close to where it was. access to mass transit makes the site ideal for office space of this size. that was a major reason why the twin towers were leased to 97% occupancy before 911. none of the other sites proposed for office development has remotely equal transportation access. with the reconstruction of the subway and path stations, plus an additional $4.5 billion in transit improvements planned, such as the new fulton transit center and the direct ""traintotheplane"" long island rail road connection, the site becomes even more the logical locus of office development. and new york will need the space. before 911, the group of 35, a task force of civic leaders led by sen. charles schumer and former treasury secretary robert rubin, concluded that the city would need an additional 60 million square feet of new office space by 2020 to accommodate the anticipated addition of 300,000 new jobs. the loss of the twin towers only heightens the need. as for those who say that 10 million square feet of office space downtown cannot be absorbed by the real estate market, i would simply point out that history shows them wrong. new york now has about 400 million square feet of office space. all new construction underway already is substantially leased up. new york had 48 million square feet of vacant office space at the beginning of the recession in 1990. by 1998, this space had been absorbed, at an annual rate of about 6 million square feet. we are seeking to rebuild 10 million square feet on the trade center site over a period of about 10 years, with the first buildings not coming on line until 2008 and the project reaching completion in 2012. this is an annual absorption rate of about a million feet, much lower than the 1990s' rate. those who argue that new york cannot reabsorb office space that it previously had are saying that the city has had its day and is entering an extended period of stagnation and decline. i will not accept this view, nor will most new yorkers. mayor michael bloomberg said in a recent interview with the new york times that the city ""has to do two things memorialize, but also build for the future."" i believe that the twin towers site can gracefully accommodate  and that downtown requires  office and retail space of architectural significance, a dignified memorial that both witnesses and recalls what happened, and cultural amenities that would benefit workers as well as residents of the area. the challenge to accomplish this is enormous. but our city is up to the task. mr. silverstein is president of silverstein properties, a real estate firm whose affiliates hold 99year leases on the world trade center site.   r. a. hettinga mailto the internet bearer underwriting corporation  44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa ""... however it may deserve respect for

""friendship is often very painful,"" said dr. harriet lerner, a psychologist and the author of ""the dance of connection."" ""in a close, enduring friendship, jealousy, envy, anger and the entire range of difficult emotions will rear their heads. one has to decide whether the best thing is to consider it a phase in a long friendship or say this is bad for my health and i'm disbanding it."" another book, ""when friendship hurts,"" by dr. jan yager, a sociologist at the university of connecticut at stamford, advises deliberately leaving bad friends by the wayside. ""there's this myth that friendships should last a lifetime,"" dr. yager said. ""but sometimes it's better that they end."" that social scientists would wait until now to spotlight the dangers of bad friends is understandable, considering that they have only recently paid close attention to friendship at all. marriage and family relationships  between siblings or parents and children  have been seen as more important. of course, troubled friendships are far less likely to lead to depression or suicide than troubled marriages are. and children are seldom seriously affected when friendships go bad. as a popular author of relationship advice books, dr. lerner said, ""never once have i had anyone write and say my best friend hits me."" dr. beverley fehr, a professor of psychology at the university of winnipeg, noted that sociological changes, like a 50 percent divorce rate, have added weight to the role of friends in emotional and physical health. ""now that a marital relationship can't be counted on for stability the way it was in the past, and because people are less likely to be living with or near extended family members, people are shifting their focus to friendships as a way of building community and finding intimacy,"" said dr. fehr, the author of ""friendship processes."" until the past couple of years, the research on friendship focused on its health benefits. ""now we're starting to look at it as a more full relationship,"" said dr. suzanna rose, a professor of psychology at florida international university in miami. ""like marriage, friendship also has negative characteristics."" the research is in its infancy. psychologists have not yet measured the ill effects of bad friendship, dr. fehr said. so far they have only, through surveys and interviews, figured out that it is a significant problem. the early research, dr. fehr added, is showing that betrayal by a friend can be more devastating than experts had thought. how can a friend be bad? most obviously, dr. rose said, by drawing a person into criminal or otherwise illadvised pursuit. ""when you think of people who were friends at enron,"" she added, ""you can see how friendship can support antisocial behavior."" betrayal also makes for a bad friendship. ""when friends split up,"" said dr. keith e. davis, a professor of psychology at the university of south carolina, ""it is often in cases where one has shared personal information or secrets that the other one wanted to be kept confidential."" another form of betrayal, dr. yager said, is when a friend suddenly turns cold, without ever explaining why. ""it's more than just pulling away,"" she said. ""the silent treatment is actually malicious."" at least as devastating is an affair with the friend's romantic partner, as recently happened to one of dr. lerner's patients. ""i would not encourage her to hang in there and work this one out,"" dr. lerner said. a third type of bad friendship involves someone who insults the other person, dr. yager said. one of the 180 people who responded to dr. yager's most recent survey on friendship described how, when she was 11, her best friend called her ""a derogatory name."" the woman, now 32, was so devastated that she feels she has been unable to be fully open with people ever since, dr. yager said. emotional abuse may be less noticeable than verbal abuse, but it is ""more insidious,"" dr. yager said. ""some people constantly set up their friends,"" she explained. ""they'll have a party, not invite the friend, but make sure he or she finds out."" risk takers, betrayers and abusers are the most extreme kinds of bad friends, dr. yager said, but they are not the only ones. she identifies 21 different varieties. occupying the second tier of badness are the liar, the person who is overly dependent, the friend who never listens, the person who meddles too much in a friend's life, the competitor and the loner, who prefers not to spend time with friends. most common is the promise breaker. ""this includes everyone from the person who says let's have a cup of coffee but something always comes up at the last minute to someone who promises to be there for you when you need them, but then isn't,"" dr. yager said. some friendships go bad, as some romantic relationships do, when one of the people gradually or suddenly finds reasons to dislike the other one. ""with couples, it can take 18 to 24 months for someone to discover there's something important they don't like about the other person,"" said dr. rose of florida international. ""one might find, for example, that in subtle ways the other person is a racist. in friendships, which are less intense, it may take even more time for one person to meet the other's dislike criteria."" whether a friendship is worth saving, dr. lerner said, ""depends on how large the injury is."" ""sometimes the mature thing is to lighten up and let something go,"" she added. ""it's also an act of maturity sometimes to accept another person's limitations."" acceptance should come easier among friends than among spouses, dr. lerner said, because people have more than one friend and do not need a full range of emotional support from each one. but if the friendship has deteriorated to the point where one friend truly dislikes the other one or finds that the friendship is causing undue stress, the healthy response is to pull away, dr. yager said, to stop sharing the personal or intimate details of life, and start being too busy to get together, ever. ""it takes two people to start and maintain a friendship, but only one to end it,"" dr. yager said. friendship, because it is voluntary and unregulated, is far easier to dissolve than marriage. but it is also comparatively fragile, experts say. ideally, the loss of a bad friendship should leave a person with more time and appreciation for good ones, dr. lerner said. ""it is wise to pay attention to your friendships and have them in order while you're healthy and your life and work are going well,"" she said. ""because when a crisis hits, when someone you love dies, or you lose your job and your health insurance, when the universe gives you a crash course in vulnerability, you will discover how crucial and lifepreserving good friendship is."" how to advertise  for information on advertising in email newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with the new york times on the web, please contact or visit our online media kit at for general information about nytimes.com, write to copyright 2002 the new york times company",[],8151,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""the idea was to determine the reliability of the satellite data by comparing it to an established independent measurement,"" christy said. ""if satellite data are reliable when the satellites are over the radiosonde sites, that means you should be able to trust them everywhere else."" the 99 radiosondes reported an aggregate warming trend of 0.155 degrees celsius (about 0.28 fahrenheit) per decade since 1979. over those 99 spots on the globe, the satellites also recorded a warming trend 0.128 degrees celsius (about 0.23 fahrenheit) per decade. globally, however, the satellite data show a cooling trend of 0.03 degrees celsius per decade since the first noaa tirosn satellites went into service. ""these 99 radiosonde launch sites are just not distributed evenly around the planet,"" christy said. ""they are not representative of the total globe."" radiosonde balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight greenwich standard time. as each balloon climbs from the surface to the stratosphere, the temperature is measured and relayed to the ground by radio. while there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally, the data from many sites either are not readily available or are not consistently collected. christy used data from 99 sites at which there has been longterm systematic and reliable data collection. these 99 radiosonde launch sites are in a box bounded by iceland, trinidad, truk island and alaska. in an earlier study, an upper air temperature record compiled by noaa from 63 daily weather balloon sites around the world indicated a 17year climate trend of 0.05 c per decade, which was in exact agreement with the satellite data at that time, christy said. global coverage one advantage of the msu dataset is its global coverage. microwave sounding units aboard noaa satellites directly measure the temperature of the atmosphere over more than 95 percent of the globe. each satellite measures the temperature above most points on earth every 12 hours. the 'global temperature' that has been frequently reported from surface measurements is neither global in extent nor systematic in measurement method. it neglects vast oceanic and continental regions, including antarctica, the brazilian rain forests, the sahara desert and greenland. the most commonly cited historical temperature dataset is from groundbased thermometers. more than 5,000 thermometers worldwide provide almost instantaneous local temperature data through links to weather services and scientists. most of these thermometers, which are usually in small shelters about five feet above the ground, are in areas easily accessible to people. in the u.s. and other industrial countries, these thermometers are most often found at airports. the groundbased network is extensive in north america, europe, russia, china and japan. it is less comprehensive in africa, south america, australia and across much of southern asia. temperatures on the surface and vertically through the atmosphere are gathered daily by thermometers carried aloft by helium balloons. ""radiosonde"" balloons are released from stations around the world, usually at noon and midnight greenwich standard time. while balloon release sites are scattered throughout the world, they are concentrated in industrial nations. there are more than 1,000 radiosonde launch sites globally. if they were evenly distributed around the world, that would equal approximately one for every 195,000 square miles of the earth's surface. water temperatures, which are used to derive estimates of atmospheric temperatures, come from thermometers on piers and buoys, and aboard ""ships of opportunity."" the ships record the temperature of water drawn in to cool their engines. the water temperature data from these instruments is also not global in its coverage, tending instead to be concentrated in heavilytravelled shipping lanes, and in harbors. in the past 12 years, a new system of approximately 100 deep ocean buoys has been established, gathering both atmospheric and water temperature data. instrument accuracy msu with nine satellites measuring the temperature over periods of from one to six years, a method was devised to merge all the data into a single, consistent time series. each satellite has its own bias that, if not calculated and removed, would introduce spurious trends. the biases are calculated by directly comparing each satellite with others in operation at that time. periods of overlapping operation ranged from three months to three years, and were sufficient to determine these biases. because the msu instruments are so stable and have so many thousands of observations, the biases between the satellites are known to within 0.01 deg. the final product removes these biases so that all data are referenced to a common base. (2) to check the final product, comparisons were made over a 16year period with balloon measurements as stated above, and the phenomenal agreement provided the independent validation necessary to conclude that the merging technique developed for this dataset was accurate. instrument accuracy groundbased thermometers of great concern to scientists is the lack of consistency in the way readings are taken and in the thermometer surroundings. since most thermometers for which longterm records exist are in towns and cities, the effects of population growth and the construction of nearby roads, parking lots, runways and buildings may cause the temperature to rise a little due of urbanization. this temperature change may be an artifact of a local ""asphalt effect"" rather than a longterm widespread climate change. instrument accuracy ships of opportunity while the temperature data collected by ships at sea is reported as a sea surface temperature, this data reflects water temperatures from about three to 60 feet below the surface  the level from which water is drawn into the ships. the thousands of individual thermometers used to collect this data are not calibrated against a scientific standard, nor is there a method for verifying the accuracy of either the thermometers or the reports matching temperature readings to specific times and places. only in places where there are many overlapping observations can there be any confidence in their accuracy. the scientists in 1996, spencer and christy received the american meteorological society's special award. they were honored ""for developing a global, precise record of the earth's temperature from operational polarorbiting satellites, fundamentally advancing our ability to monitor climate."" ams special awards are given to individuals or organizations not appropriately recognized by more specificallydefined awards, and who have made important contributions to the science or practice of meteorology or to the society. in 1991, spencer and christy received nasa's exceptional scientific achievement medal. dr. john christy christy began his scientific career as a senior research associate at uah in 1987, after earning his b.a.

""with digital machines and other new recording formats taking hold in the market, demand has continued to decline and it has become difficult to secure parts,"" sony said in a statement. sony said it would continue to offer repairs and manufacture tapes for the format. the professional betamax format, betacam, is still widely used in the television and film industries and will be unaffected. but the recent rise of dvds seems to have put the final nail in the coffin for betamax home players. in the 1980s, many video rental chains preferred the vhs format. betamax lovers became so passionate about the format in the face of competition from vhs that they set up the betaphile club in 1988. the picture and sound quality of beta was superior to vhs, betaphiles say, although vhs tapes had a longer duration. a total of 18 million betamax machines were sold around the world, but no new ones will be made after the end of 2002. sony is now planning to focus its efforts on new digital technologies. see also  yahoo! groups sponsor  kwick pick portable lock pick  opens almost any lock! locked out? try the kwick pick. for $17.95, you can open car doors, desk drawers, padlocks, and much more! never get locked out again!  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to your use of yahoo! groups is subject to",[],2428,0,0,easy_ham_testing

september 11 there is no going back. september 11 changed our world. those who deny such a watershed event take a superficially shortterm view, and seem to think all is as before simply because the sun still rises and sets. this is a colossal misjudgment. the collapse of the towers, the crashing into the pentagon, and the murder of 3,000 americans  all seen live in real time by millions the world over  tore off a scab and exposed deep wounds, which, if and when they heal, will leave ugly scars for decades. the killers dealt in icons  the choice of 911 as the date of death, targeting the manifest symbols of global capitalism and american military power, and centering their destruction on the largest jewish city in the world. yes, they got their symbols in spades, but they have no idea that their killing has instead become emblematic of changes that they could scarcely imagine. islamic fundamentalism has proved not ascendant, but static, morally repugnant  and the worst plague upon the arab world since the crusades. by lurking in the shadows and killing incrementally through stealth, the vampirish terrorists garnered bribes and subsidies through threats and bombs but pale and wrinkled in the daylight after 911, they prove only ghoulish not fearsome. the more the world knows of al qaeda and bin laden, the more it has found them both vile and yet banal  and so is confident and eager to eradicate them and all they stand for. it is one thing to kill innocents, quite another to take on the armed might of an aroused united states. easily dodging a solo cruise missile in the vastness of afghanistan may make good theater and bring about braggadocio dealing with grim american and british commandos who have come 7,000 miles for your head prompts abject flight and an occasional cheap infomercial on the run. and the ultimate consequence of the attacks of september 11 will not merely be the destruction of al qaeda, but also the complete repudiation of the taliban, the iranian mullocracy, the plague of the pakistani madrassas, and any other wouldbe fundamentalist paradise on earth. foreign relations will not be the same in our generation. our coalition with europe, we learn, was not a partnership, but more mere alphabetic nomenclature and the mutual back scratching of euroamerican globetrotters  a paper alliance without a mission nearly 15 years after the end of the cold war. the truth is that europe, out of noble purposes, for a decade has insidiously eroded its collective national sovereignty in order to craft an antidemocratic eu, a 80,000person fuzzy bureaucracy whose executive power is as militarily weak as it is morally ambiguous in its reliance on often dubious international accords. this sad realization september 11 brutally exposed, and we all should cry for the beloved continent that has for the moment completely lost its moral bearings. indeed, as the months progressed the problems inherent in ""the european way"" became all too apparent pretentious utopian manifestos in lieu of military resoluteness, abstract moralizing to excuse dereliction of concrete ethical responsibility, and constant american anklebiting even as europe lives in a makebelieve shire while we keep back the forces of mordor from its picturesque borders, with only a few brave frodos and bilbos tagging along. nothing has proved more sobering to americans than the skepticism of these blinkered european hobbits after september 11. america learned that ""moderate"" arab countries are as dangerous as hostile islamic nations. after september 11, being a saudi, egyptian, or kuwaiti means nothing special to an american  at least not proof of being any more friendly or hostile than having libyan, syrian, or lebanese citizenship. indeed, our entire postwar policy of propping up autocracies on the triad of their anticommunism, oil, and arms purchases  like nato  belongs to a pre911 age of soviet aggrandizement and petroleum monopolies. now we learn that broadcasting statesponsored hatred of israel and the united states is just as deadly to our interests as scud missiles  and as likely to come from friends as enemies. worstcase scenarios like iran and afghanistan offer more longterm hope than ""stable regimes"" like the saudis governments that hate us have populations that like us  and vice versa the saudi royal family, whom 5,000 american troops protect, and the mubarak autocracy, which has snagged billions of american dollars, are as afraid of democratic reformers as they are islamic fundamentalists. and with good reason islamic governments in iran and under the taliban were as hated by the masses as arab secular reformers in exile in the west are praised and championed. the post911 domestic calculus is just as confusing. generals and the military brass call civilians who seek the liberation of iraq ""chicken hawks"" and worse. yet such traditional vietnamera invective i think rings hollow after september 11, and sounds more like mcclellan's shrillness against his civilian overseers who precipitously wanted an odious slavery ended than resonant of patton's audacity in charging after murderous nazis. more americans were destroyed at work in a single day than all those soldiers killed in enemy action since the evacuation of vietnam nearly 30 years ago. indeed, most troops who went through the ghastly inferno of vietnam are now in or nearing retirement and, thank god, there is no generation of americans in the present military  other than a few thousand brave veterans of the gulf, mogadishu, and panama  who have been in sustained and deadly shooting with heavy casualties. because american soldiers and their equipment are as impressive as our own domestic security is lax, in this gruesome war it may well be more perilous to work high up in lower manhattan, fly regularly on a jumbo jet, or handle mail at the pentagon or cia than be at sea on a sub or destroyer. real concern for the sanctity of life may hinge on employing rather than rejecting force, inasmuch as our troops are as deadly and protected abroad as our women, children, aged, and civilians are impotent and vulnerable at home. it seems to me a more moral gamble to send hundreds of pilots into harm's way than allow a madman to further his plots to blow up or infect thousands in highrises. politics have been turned upside down. in the old days, cynical conservatives were forced to hold their noses and to practice a sometimes repellent realpolitik. in the age of russian expansionism, they were loathe to champion democracy when it might usher in a socialist trojan horse whose belly harbored totalitarians disguised as parliamentarians. thus they were so often at loggerheads with nave and idealist leftists. no longer. the end of the specter of a deadly and aggressive soviet communism has revived democratic ideology as a force in diplomacy. champions of freedom no longer sigh and back opportunistic rightist thugs who promise open economics, loot their treasuries, and keep out the russians. instead, even reactionaries are now more likely to push for democratic governments in the middle east than are dour and skeptical leftists. the latter, if multiculturalists, often believe that democracy is a valueneutral western construct, not necessarily a universal good if pacifists, they claim nonintervention, not justice, as their first priority. the right, not the left, now is the greater proponent of global freedom, liberation, and idealism  with obvious domestic ramifications for any republican president astute enough to tap that rich vein of popular support. all this and more are the wages of the disaster of september 11 and the subsequent terrible year  and yet it is likely that, for good or evil, we will see things even more incredible in the twelve months ahead.",[],7958,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""we're obviously in favor of releasing the information, but we can't until we're told what to do,"" said matthys levy, an engineer and founding partner at weidlinger associates, who is a consultant in the case and the author of ""why buildings fall down how structures fail"" (norton, 2nd edition, 2002). ""let's just say we understand the mechanics of the whole process"" of the collapse, mr. levy said. monica gabrielle, who lost her husband, richard, when the south tower fell and who is a member of the skyscraper safety campaign, said the information should be disclosed. ""if they have answers and are not going to share them, i would be devastated,"" mrs. gabrielle said. ""they have a moral obligation."" the lawsuit that has generated the information involves larry a. silverstein, whose companies own a lease on the trade center property, and a consortium of insurance companies. mr. silverstein maintains that each jetliner that hit the towers constituted a separate terrorist attack, entitling him to some $7 billion, rather than half that amount, as the insurance companies say. as both sides have prepared their arguments, they have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars acquiring expert opinion about exactly what happened to the towers. dean davison, a spokesman for industrial risk insurers of hartford, one of the insurance companies in the suit, said of the findings, ""there are some confidentiality agreements that are keeping those out of the public domain today."" he conceded that differing opinions among the more than 20 insurers on his side of the case could complicate any release of the material. as for his own company, whose consultants alone have produced more than 1,700 pages of analysis and thousands of diagrams and photographs, mr. davison said every attempt would be made to give the material eventually to ""public authorities and investigative teams."" still, some of that analysis relies on information like blueprints and building records from other sources, like the port authority of new york and new jersey, which built and owned the trade center and supports mr. silverstein in the suit. mr. davison said he was uncertain how the differing origins of the material would influence his company's ability to release information. in a statement, the port authority said access to documents would be ""decided on a casebycase basis consistent with applicable law and policy,"" adding that it would cooperate with ""federal investigations."" the fate of the research is particularly critical to resolve unanswered questions about why the towers fell, given the dissatisfaction with the first major inquiry into the buildings' collapse. that investigation, led by the federal emergency management agency, was plagued by few resources, a lack of access to crucial information like building plans, and infighting among experts and officials. a new federal investigation intended to remedy those failings has just begun at the national institute of standards and technology, or nist, an agency that has studied many building disasters. officials with nist have said it could take years to make final determinations and recommendations for other buildings, a process they now acknowledge might be speeded up with access to the analysis done by the consultants on the lawsuit. gerald mckelvey, a spokesman for mr. silverstein, said of the real estate executive's own heavily financed investigative work, ""we decline to comment other than to say that silverstein is cooperating fully with the nist investigation."" a spokesman for the agency confirmed it was in discussions with mr. silverstein on the material, but said no transfer had taken place. with no shortage of money or expertise, investigations by both sides in the legal case have produced a startling body of science and theory, some of it relevant not only to the trade center disaster but to other skyscrapers as well. ""the work should be available to other investigators,"" said ramon gilsanz, a structural engineer and managing partner at gilsanz murray steficek, who was a member of the earlier inquiry. ""it could be used to build better buildings in the future."" legal experts say confidentiality arrangements like the one governing the material can lead to a variety of outcomes, from full or partial disclosure to destruction of such information. in some cases, litigants who paid for the reports may make them public themselves. or they may ask to have them sealed forever. ""it is not unusual for one party or another to try to keep some of those documents secret for one reason or another, some legitimate, some not,"" said lee levine, a first amendment lawyer at levine sullivan  koch in washington. mr. levine said that because of the presumed value of the information, the court might look favorably on requests to make it public. but the uncertainty over the fate of the material is unnerving to many people, especially experts who believe that only a complete review of the evidence  not piecemeal disclosures by litigants eager to protect their own interests  could lead to an advance in the federal investigation of the trade center. ""it's important for this to get presented and published and subjected to some scrutiny,"" said dr. john osteraas, director of civil engineering practice at exponent failure analysis in menlo park, calif., and a consultant on the case, ""because then the general engineering community can sort it out."" the scope of the investigation behind the scenes is vast by any measure. mr. levy and his colleagues at weidlinger associates, hired by silverstein properties, have called upon powerful computer programs, originally developed with the pentagon for classified research, to create a model of the sept. 11 attack from beginning to end. the result is a compilation of threedimensional images of the severed exterior columns, smashed floor and damaged core of the towers, beginning with the impacts and proceeding up to the moments of collapse. those images  which mr. levy is not allowed to release  have helped pinpoint the structural failures. the fema investigators did not have access to such computer modeling. nor did the fema team have unfettered access to the trade center site, with all its evidence, in the weeks immediately after the attacks. but no such constraints hampered engineers at lzathorntontomasetti, brought to the site for emergency work beginning on the afternoon of sept. 11. daniel a. cuoco, the company president and a consultant to silverstein properties on the case, said he had assembled detailed maps of the blazing debris at ground zero in models that perhaps contain further clues about how the towers fell. though the fema team could not determine ""where things actually fell,"" mr. cuoco said, ""we've indicated the specific locations."" mr. cuoco said he could not reveal any additional details of the findings. nor would mr. osteraas discuss the details of computer calculations his company has done on the spread of fires in large buildings like the twin towers. mr. osteraas has also compiled an extensive archive of photographs and videos of the towers that day, some of which he believes have not been available to other investigators. and the investigation has not limited itself to computers and documentary evidence. for months, experiments in wind tunnels in the united states and canada have been examining the aerodynamics that fed the flames that day and stressed the weakening structures. jack cermak, president of cermak peterka peterson in fort collins, colo., was retained by the insurance companies but had previously performed windtunnel studies for the original design of the twin towers nearly 40 years ago. for the legal case, dr. cermak said, ""we've done probably more detailed measurements than in the original design."" ""the data that have been acquired are very valuable in themselves for understanding how wind and buildings interact,"" dr. cermak said. ""some of the information may be valuable for the litigation,"" he said, adding, ""i think i've told you all i can."" how to advertise  for information on advertising in email newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with the new york times on the web, please contact or visit our online media kit at for general information about nytimes.com, write to copyright 2002 the new york times company",[],10869,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""the fact that they have now concluded that they are comfortable in accepting gm crops or commodities will be an important signal to other countries in the region,"" mr morris told journalists. ""it will enable us to do our job,"" he said. aid workers say up to 13 million people in seven countries in southern africa face famine. in zimbabwe which was once the bread basket of the region, some six million people are estimated to need food aid. the wfp says it already has aid pledges for about half of the 600,000 tonnes of food it intends to bring into zimbabwe in the next few months. the government blames the shortages solely on drought, but the government's campaign to transfer land from large scale commercial white farmers has worsened the situation, say many donors. lost markets the gm row has complicated relief efforts across the region. zambia's president is refusing to overturn his ban on gm food aid, labelling it as 'poison' . deals to mill gm food before being distributed, so that it could not be planted, have placated fears in malawi and mozambique. united states aid officials deny that the food is unsafe, pointing out that americans eat gm maize every day. the world health organisation has certified the grain for human consumption and says it does not constitute a danger to people's health.  yahoo! groups sponsor  looking for a more powerful website? try geocities for $8.95 per month. register your domain name ( more storage! no ads!  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to your use of yahoo! groups is subject to",[],2900,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(the joke of putting 42 into goggle to find that model was not missed btw) most production systems use a mix of batteries and capacitors, as very few real world applications run for less then 10 seconds like the car we were talking about originally. even 10 seconds is pushing the ""capactior is the wrong choice"" limits. thats why the landspeed record model is a battery one, it's got to run for a much longer period of time and needs a steady discharge curve. but it should be safe to say that most people want the indy 500 version, not the 14 mile sprint version when they are looking for a vehice ) for those you dont want a battery or a capacitor, you want to take advantage of whole atoms, not just electrons. then you can suck off the electrons you need with a fuel cell. however, you will use both capacitors for the brakingaccel, and batteries to not just dump excess energy in the design.  adam l.

in a nutshell, a thoroughly pathological culture and society. few women reach the age of 16 without getting pregnant. incest, rape, and gross promiscuity is rampant. inbreeding, heavy drug abuse during pregnancy, and other environmental factors have created tribes where a very substantial fraction of the tribe is literally mentally retarded. many of the thoughtful and intelligent tribe members leave the reservation at the earliest opportunity, mostly to avoid the problems mentioned above. on one reservation my parents lived, the hiv infection rate was 70%. many of these societies are thoroughly corrupt, and the administration of the law is arbitrary and capricious (they do have their own judges, courts, police etc). in short, many of these tribes that are still hanging together are in a shambles because they have become the most pathological societies that i have ever seen anywhere. because of their legal status, there really aren't that many consequences for their behavior. there are many things that i could tell you that i've seen that you probably would not believe unless you'd seen it yourself. there are always good people in these tribes, but it has gotten to the point where the losers and idiots outnumber the good guys by a fair margin many times, and this is a mobocracy typically. (btw, if any of you white folk wants to experience overt and aggressive racism as a minority in a place where the rule of law is fiction and the police are openly thugs, try living on one of these messed up indian reservations. it will give you an interesting perspective on things.) there are only two real situations where you find reasonably prosperous indians. the first is in the rare case of tribes run by disciplined and intelligent people that have managed their assets wisely. the second is where the tribe has dispersed and assimilated for the most part, even if they maintain their tribal identity. in both of these cases, the tribal leaders reject the insular behavior that tends to lead to the pathological cases mentioned above. the indians are often quite wealthy technically, and a lot of money is spent by the tribe per capita. and the actual reportable income is quite high when you consider how many are living entirely off the tribal dole. it is just that their peculiar economic structure does not lend itself well to ordinary economic analysis by merely looking at their nominal income. the poverty is social and cultural in nature, not economic. this was my original point. on a tangent one thing that has always interested me is the concept of quasitribal corporate socialism. many indian tribes implement a type of corporate socialism that is mindbogglingly bad in execution. that they use this structure at all is an accident of history more than anything. but what has interested me is that the very smartly managed ones do surprisingly well over the long run. it is like a family corporation writ large. it seems that in a future where ""familial"" ties will be increasingly voluntary, the general concept may have some merit in general western society, serving to create a facsimile of a biological extended family with the included dynamics, but with an arbitrary set of selfselecting individuals. damn that was long (and its late), and it could have been a lot longer. james rogers on 92202 353 pm, ""john hall"" wrote   as i understand it, there is a huge difference between native americans  who speak english at home and those who do not. i don't have figures  that separate those at hand, though.   1989 american indians (us pop as a whole)  families below poverty  27.2% (10%), persons below poverty 31.2 (13.1), speak a language other  than english 23 (13.8) married couple families 65.8 (79.5) median family  income $21,619 ($35,225) per capita $8,284 ($14,420).",[],8428,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""the unanimous support of the senate commerce committee is a very big step forward for this very small technology,"" lieberman, who vowed to pushed to full senate passage before the end of the year, said. ""nowhere in the world are the wheels of innovation spinning more rapidly than in the realm of nanotechnology. the u.s. certainly possesses the raw resources and talent to lead the world in developing this technology. our legislation will provide the nation with a longterm focus and sustained commitment, and facilitate new collaborations between government, academia, and industry that will ensure our place at the head of the next wave of innovation."" the bill would place coordination and management of the nanotechnology program under the national science and technology council. it would also create a presidential national nanotechnology advisory panel and national nanotechnology coordination office, which would provide administrative and technical support for the advisory panel and the council. ""my own judgment is the nanotechnology revolution has the potential to change america on a scale equal to, if not greater than, the computer revolution. i am determined that the united states will not miss, but will mine the opportunities of nanotechnology,"" wyden said in introducing the bill. ""at present, efforts in the nanotechnology field are strewn across a halfdozen federal agencies. i want america to marshal its various nanotechnology efforts into one driving force to remain the world's leader in this burgeoning field. and i believe federal support is essential to achieving that goal. to study the potential longterm effects of nanotechnology, a new center for societal, ethical, educational, legal and workforce issues related to nanotechnology would also be established. according to lieberman, the bill closely tracks the recommendations of the national research council (nrc), which completed a thorough review of the national nanotechnology initiative in june. those recommendations included establishing an independent advisory panel emphasizing longterm goals striking a balance between longterm and shortterm research supporting the development of research facilities, equipment and instrumentation creating special funding to support research that falls in the breach between agency missions and programs promoting interdisciplinary research and research groups facilitating technology transition and outreach to industry conducting studies on the societal implications of nanotechnology, including those related to ethical, educational, legal and workforce issues and the development of metrics for measuring progress toward program goals.",[],3558,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(right now i'm taking time out to write email while waiting for a job to run). sure i could wait 5 years until everyone's pc is fast enough to generate random ec's in no time, when any twit will be able to program inefficient code that is fast enough and the market will be overrun by competitors, or i can do it now when very few people can. the end goal is the scientific or business problem to be solved. yes. and for those problems, languages such as java, smalltalk, and others allow you to think more high level than low level. thinking of bits and bytes takes too much gray matter away from the real important problems.... it's true! i admit everything! mea maxima culpa! working in c makes me spend all day thinking base, rank thoughts about hardcore bitography! not. actually i spend most of my time thinking in highlevel mathematics. why do most computer scientists insist on solving the same problems over and over again ... dunno, and frankly i don't see the relevance to the issue at hand. i'm sure java is fine for some stuff, as is c or whatever. horses for courses. bye, rob. .. ..   .. ..       ..  ..

'deserved death' chapman has said that he should have received the death penalty for his crime. lennon's widow told the 2000 parole hearing that she would not feel safe if chapman were released. lennon's songwriting partnership with paul mccartney propelled the liverpoolbased pop group to international stardom and unparalleled commercial success. the beatles front man, peace campaigner, and allround iconoclast, would have been 62 on wednesday.  yahoo! groups sponsor  plan to sell a home?  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to your use of yahoo! groups is subject to",[],2152,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(short, of course, for  the ""global realists' electoral exchange  democratic""). politicians  we believe in will see their stocks rise higher as faith in their  ability to maintain office grows. as the truth about their embezzling  campaign funds for weekend trips to maui with their interns is  revealed, of course, their fortunes will fall.   this represents an opportunity for the market forces  those same  forces which you intend to harness to express your own personal  protest  to voice their opinion on the quality of america's  governance during the intervening four years between elections.  elections themselves will in effect become meaningless, as they are  now, since their outcome will be influenced by the stock price of each  and every congressman, senator, and presidential candidate.   just think of the coverage that could be given on msnbc! ""strom  thurman (strom news  quotes) was down 15% today on fears that his  latest heart operation will render him unable to attend senate armed  services committee meetings until november.."" this would provide  rejuvenating content to the econopolitical news sector, which has  found posteconomicbubble coverage to be both tiresome and  deoressing. the establishment of this new stock exchange would of  course create jobs for newly unemployed (and governmentally retrained)  it systems engineers who could, after passing the electoral securities  exam, become floor traders.   this would also allow for a convenient and very public method by which  candidates could raise capital in the public markets to support their  multibilliondollar campaigns. the requirement for the support of  legions of spin doctors, permanent campaign managers, and investor  relations personnel would also create jobs  perhaps even a new  practice for ernst  young, arthur anderson, et al. insider trading  scandals and misleading revenue declarations would of course catch  martha stewart as an unwitting beneficiary, thus spreading her  influence to politics.   dividends, if there are any on record, at the close of a politician's  career could be paid to current shareholders based on the holdings.  pensions funds could provide the institutional investment support  necessary to underpin even the biggest dogs among the beltway set.  union funds, brokerages, and even pumpanddump houses could benefit  from meteoric rises in conservative candidates running in the  southeast, and the bush governmet would be allowed to place social  security bets where they really mattered. investors who lose their  retirement, life savings, and support could rest assured that they  were indeed robbed by crooks rather than poor investors.   although there's no way to protect any of these for worldcomlike  crashes, ambitious, inspired, district attorneys could file criminal  suits against candidates and campaign managers who underperform  expectations, thus assuring investors that their logic was not faulty   instead, they were merely defrauded by crooks and thieves.   on the whole, i believe the system could work. i could certainly work  as well as our beloved securities trading industry and, given the  american electoral system's success at effectively expressing the will  of the people, it certainly couldn't do any worse...   in the meantime, mike, i think i'll go see your movie and try to  depose the president.   ian.     on wednesday, october 9, 2002, at 0353 pm, michael moore's mailing  list wrote   october 9, 2002   my film, ""bowling for columbine,"" opens this friday   dear friends, fans, and fellow evildoers   i am very happy and excited to tell you that this friday, october 11,  my  new  film, ""bowling for columbine,"" will open in new york and los angeles.   it is, i promise, the last thing the bushies want projected on the  movie  screens across america this week. the film is, first and foremost, a  devastating indictment of the violence that is done in our name for  profit  and power  and no one, in all the advance screenings i have  attended, has  left the theatre with anything short of rage. i truly believe this  film has  the potential to rock the nation and get people energized to do  something.   this is not good news for junior and company. not when they are  trying to  drag us into another war. not when a crazed sniper is exercising his  constitutional right to own a highpowered rifle. not when john  ashcroft is  still prohibiting the fbi from looking through the gun background  check  files to see if any of the 19 hijackers or their associates purchased  any  weapons prior to 911  because that, we are told, would ""violate""  these  terrorists' sacred second amendment rights!   yes, i believe this movie can create a lot of havoc  but i will  need all  of you to help me do this. are you game?   last february 5th, i wrote to tell you about a book i had written and  how  the publisher had decided to dump it because they were afraid to  publish  anything critical of bush after 911. i appealed to you to save  ""stupid  white men"" from the shredder and to go out and buy it. i promised you  would  not regret it, and that the book would not only be a great read but an  important organizing tool in gumming up the plans of george w. bush.   within 24 hours, the book went to 1 on the amazon best seller list.  by the  fifth day, the book was already into its 9th printing. the publisher  was  torn between its desire to kill the book or make a wad of money.  greed won  out, and this sunday the book enters its 31st week on the new york  times  best seller list  and its 32nd printing. this is all because of  you, my  crazy and loyal friends. you made this happen, against all the odds.   now i would like to ask you again to help me with my latest work,  ""bowling  for columbine."" it's a movie that many critics have already called my  best  film to date. they may be right. it is certainly the most provocative  thing  i have ever done. i have spent three years on it and, i have to say,  it  cuts  deeper, harder and funnier that anything i have given you so far.   the movie opens this friday in new york and los angeles, and then in  8 more  cities next week. how it does in these first ten cities will determine  whether or not the rest of the country gets to see it. that is the  nutty  way  our films are released. if it doesn't have a big opening weekend, you  can  kiss the film goodbye. therefore, this weekend, this film must be  seen by  millions of americans. can you help me make that happen?   ""bowling for columbine"" is not a film simply about guns or school  shootings.  that is only the starting point for my 2hour journey into the dark  soul of  a country that is both victim and master of an enormous amount of  violence,  both at home and around the world. with this movie i have broadened my  canvas to paint a portrait of our nation at the beginning of the 21st  century, a nation that seems hellbent on killing first and asking  questions  later. it is a movie about the state sponsored acts of violence and  terrorism against our own poor, and how we have created a culture of  fear  that is based on the racial dilemma we continue to ignore. and it's a  devastating comedy.   this film is going to upset some pretty big apple carts. no film has  ever  said the things i am saying in ""bowling for columbine."" i expect to be  attacked. i expect certain theatres will not show it for fear of  retribution. i expect that this movie will be a bitter pill for many  to  swallow.   this is why i need your help. movies live or die based on what  happens at  the box office the first weekend of its release. i need you, if you  live in  the new york or l.a. area, to go see ""bowling for columbine"" this  friday  and  saturday  and take as many family members and friends with you as  possible. i guarantee you will not be disappointed  and you may  just see  one of the best films of the year.   monday night in times square, ""bowling for columbine"" had its  premiere. the  crowd was amazing, as it was this past saturday night at the chicago  film  festival. the audience kept laughing or hooting or applauding so loud  throughout the film that it was hard to hear the next line.   the hate mail, the threats, the promises of retribution have already  started  to roll in to the distributor of this movie, united artists. they are  not  backing down. but how long will this last? i need all of you in the  new  york  tristate and southern california areas to go see ""bowling for  columbine""  this weekend  the rest of you can see it in a couple of weeks when  it  comes to your town. a strong opening not only means that the rest of  america  will see this film, it means that a good number of people who see it  are  going to leave the film angry enough to get active and get involved.  if it  does poorly, i will have a difficult time finding the funding for the  movie  i want to make next  a film about 911 and how bush is using that  tragic  day as a cover for his rightwing agenda.   don't let that happen. don't let the nra have one more success by  stopping  the wider distribution of this movie. and, together, let us not remain  silent in our opposition to bush's phony war against iraq.   if you live in new york, you can see it at the lincoln plaza, the  sunshine  and the loews 19th st. in l.a., you can catch it at the sunset 5, the  westwood regent, laemmle sunset, laemmle towncenter (encino), landmark  rialto (pasadena), and regal university (irvine). also, please  forward this  to your other friends and tell them to go see ""bowling for columbine""  this  weekend.   and finally, don't miss our new website   thank you for your help with this. i feel so honored and privileged  to have  so many people interested in my work. last january i was getting  70,000  hits  a month on my website. last month, i got 17 million hits. this alone  speaks  volumes about the vast majority all of us belong to who are sick and  tired  of what is going on and are longing for an alternative source of  information.   i hope that you enjoy ""bowling for columbine.""   thank you again...   yours,   michael moore      if you wish to be be unsubscribed from this mailing list, please  click the  link below and follow the instructions.",[],12875,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""it was big and impressive and could be seen for miles about. they tied it to bushes at the top and nailed it down. it caused all the stone chippings to be pushed downwards, which will help turn the white horse grey. it will not get another refit for another year. ""whoever did it must have come with a vehicle  a tractor and trailer or a lorry  because the carpet must have come in one piece. it was extremely well planned and took several people an hour and a half to get it off."" the sculpture needs constant work because, unlike chalk horses in the south of england, it is cut into limestone which is the wrong colour and needs whitening. mr roberts added ""the damage as such is not great but it adds to the deterioration, which means it will need more work next time. ""we would have more sympathy if, having made the point, they would come to take it away again because it was a major job."" andy wilson, chief executive of the north york moors national park, said ""it is a scheduled ancient monument and the local residents are very proud of it and go to enormous trouble to keep it white. there is also careful consideration of what shape it should be kept with the constant growth of vegetation so you can understand the alarm and regret at any changes. there has not been a cut in the turf  which would be much more of a problem. it would seem it was carefully plotted beforehand."" an rca spokesman said ""some people in the country are getting very frustrated at the inaction. all we want is ministers to take notice. marches don't seem to be doing anything good."" the countryside alliance said it did not have any part in the action. spokesman adrian yelland said ""the countryside alliance only ever advocates campaigning that is lawful and dissociates itself from acts of vandalism and regrets any damage that may have been caused by this incident."" the incident follows graffiti on road signs and motorway bridges in yorkshire thought to be rca work.  yahoo! groups sponsor  4 dvds free sp join now  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to your use of yahoo! groups is subject to",[],3750,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""it seems to me that the main justification they've given for all the changes is that we want to ratify the cybercrime treaty and we need to make changes,"" geist said. ""to me that's not a particularly convincing argument. if there are new powers needed for law enforcement authority, make that case."" geist added that ""there's nothing in the document that indicates (new powers) are needed. i don't know that there have been a significant number of cases where police have run into problems."" probably the most sweeping change the legal blueprint contemplates is compelling internet providers and telephone companies to reconfigure their networks to facilitate government eavesdropping and dataretention orders. the united states has a similar requirement, called the communications assistance for law enforcement act  but it applies only to preinternet telecommunications companies. ""it is proposed that all service providers (wireless, wireline and internet) be required to ensure that their systems have the technical capability to provide lawful access to law enforcement and national security agencies,"" according to the proposal. companies would be responsible for paying the costs of buying new equipment. sarah andrews, an analyst at the electronic privacy information center  (epic) who specializes in international law, says the proposal goes beyond what the cybercrime treaty specifies. ""their proposal for intercept capability talks about all service providers, not just internet providers,"" andrews said. ""the cybercrime treaty deals only with computer data."" epic opposes  the cybercrime treaty, saying it grants too much power to police and does not adequately respect privacy rights. another section of the proposal says the canadian association of chiefs of police recommends ""the establishment of a national database"" with personal information about all canadian internet users. ""the implementation of such a database would presuppose that service providers are compelled to provide accurate and current information,"" the draft says. gus hosein, a visiting fellow at the london school of economics and an activist with privacy international, calls the database ""a dumb idea."" ""immediately you have to wonder if you're allowed to use anonymous mobile phones or whether you're allowed to connect to the internet anonymously,"" hosein said. a representative for george radwanski  canada's privacy commissioner, said the office is reviewing the blueprint and does not ""have any comments on the paper as it stands."" comments on the proposal can be sent to no later than nov. 15.",[],6163,0,0,easy_ham_testing

you don't think this has anything to do with .net being a competitor to java do you? or that ms has basically copied java (with some additional features) and called it c? isn't that alone an indication that they actually do think that a vm is the right way to go for most high level applications? reza b'far wrote 2. c and c forces the developer to solve problems such as memory management over and over again. robert harley wrote can't say i spend any noticeable amount of time on memory management issues, apart from the fact that i frequently need  4 gb. hmmm again.... you're telling me that you've never had a nasty bug that took you a couple of days to track down that had to do with a memory leak? i am not the best cc programmer... not even close... but i've known really good ones... and even they have nasty bugs that have to do with memory management, however occasional they may be. it's about design patterns, architecture, high level stuff... robert harley wrote if your problem just requires application of a ""design pattern"" to solve, then it's trivial anyway irrespective of language. wow! so you're telling me that unless the application involves bitcounting, it's trivial? what about the application itself? what about high level problems such as task distribution, workflow, etc.? aren't most high level problems solved with high level solutions like design patterns? or do you solve high level problems by writing optimal cc code? for example, do you think that most people working on collaboration frameworks (there are lots of them on this list), are working on writing an operating system with assembly that provides for a collaborative environment? i am amazed by the amount of time wasted by people talking about low level problems that have been solved 10 million times over and over and over again... robert harley wrote you appear to be gratuitously asserting that c programmers waste time on irrelevant lowlevel problems and java programmers don't. depends entirely on the programmer, not the language. i can see how you could infer this. however, what i believe to really be the case is that java is one of the best languages for writing large applications with many components that involves the collaboration of more than three programmers. in those cases, it's always very hard to get the programmers to agree on api's, memory management techniques, etc. with java, the jcp takes care of the discussions so that you don't sit around in a long meeting trying to decide what api to use to hook up to a database (jdbc) or a messaging bus (jms). 3. java is not just a programming language! it's also a platform... robert harley wrote buzzword. yikes! have you written db code with cc for different databases (just an example)? tried porting a persistence layer from windows to unix? say you have informix running on solaris and you want to port to windows with ms sql (bad idea...but for the sake of the example), would you rather deal with jdbc port or cc port that uses informix drivers and now you have to use odbc? a monolithic set of api's or a crap load of different api's slicing and dicing the same problems 50 different ways? robert harley wrote unsupported assertion. so, are you saying that there is a standard set of api's for cc for everything? (aside to the minimal ansi stuff). is there a standard way of dealing with cc applications for various domain problems (messaging, database persistence, etc.) that rivals java? i'd like to know if there is one accepted by everyone who writes cc... in that case, i claim ignorance... not suggesting that java is the golden hammer.... just that cc is overkill for most things... i even coded in vb... but vb is a true disgrace to programming... it's just lame... java is object oriented... (no flamemail from the antioo people please... that is a religious discussion...) and relatively clean... and i don't think that every ""kid"" can write a well designed java program. kids typically don't understand various design patterns and principles... to my experience, they actually tend to think more of the low level problems, wanting to rewrite and reinvent the world... a tendency that is much more possible, imho, in cc than in java due to existence of standard api's.",[],6262,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""for people outside of seattle who don't understand the consumption of espresso, the tax proposal can be seen as crazy,"" said john burbank, the think tank's executive director, ""but it was common sense."" research by his nonprofit economic opportunity institute showed that people preferred a tax on liquor or beer over one on espresso. but because of the large number of lattes and cappuccinos sold, a tax on espresso could be lower than one levied on alcohol. burbank estimates the tax could generate $7 million to $10 million a year. city council aides dispute his figures, saying their research shows the tax would bring in $1.5 million to $3 million a year. burbank's institute is funded by foundations and labor unions. the think tank's mission is to promote public policy in the interests of lowincome people, and it has long championed childcare issues. burbank says the tax would restore cuts to the childcare programs made earlier this year by gov. gary locke. he also says it would provide more lowincome families with subsidies for child care, improve preschool programs and increase teacher salaries. at bauhaus books  coffee, the sidewalk is dotted with tables of customers for whom coffee is a halfday activity, not just a drink. espresso lovers like chris altman, who at a dime a day would spend an extra $36.50 a year, said the investment is worth it. ""i'm ok with it,"" said the 35yearold, stirring his iced latte. ""the money's got to come from somewhere."" hope revuelto, 25, was cooling her regular coffee ($1 because she brought her own mug) and reading ""zen and the art of pottery."" she supports the initiative and said its critics are behaving as would be expected of espresso drinkers they want the most expensive thing on the menu but resist paying 10 cents to help the needy. some say the tax isn't the issue they just resent being singled out. david marsh, 45, a costume manager, drinks up to three espressos a day, which means he'd be shelling out an extra $109.50 a year. ""i, for one, don't have kids, but i drink espresso,"" he said, as he sewed a leather collar onto a chainmail tunic. ""i don't mind paying, but i think everyone should pay."" coffeehouses are steamed about it, and they've organized as joltjoined to oppose the latte tax. among the members are seattle's chamber of commerce and the city's two largest coffee franchises, starbucks and tully's. the tax would force coffeehouses to track sales of any beverage that contains espresso, a task that could be an administrative nightmare for smaller cafes, especially during the frantic morning rush. if espresso counts come under suspicion, coffeehouse owners could face a city audit. university of chicago economics professor michael greenstone said the tax doesn't add up. ""the purpose of any tax is to be efficient and equitable, and this is neither,"" he said. ""on the efficiency side, it's surely going to lead to costly efforts by both businesses and consumers to find ways to avoid the tax. for example, starbucks could claim that they are using finely ground coffee, instead of coffee run though an espresso maker and that consequently, they are exempt from the tax. would they be right? i don't know, but finding out will surely take lots of legal fees that could have gone to child care. ""of course, from a publicrelations perspective, this is an ingenious idea, and i mean that in a cynical way. they've pitted espresso drinkers against childcare supporters, and who's going to side with the espresso drinkers?"" in fact, the proposed tax has forced opponents into a political twostep, where their criticism must remain a beat behind their public stance of political correctness. in a liberal city like seattle, corporations continually advertise their commitment to social activism, and throughout the debate over the initiative, jolt members prefaced their opposition with endorsements of good child care. ""starbucks will continue to support earlylearning and childhooddevelopment programs through the millions of dollars we contribute annually,"" the company said. ""however, starbucks does not understand why the economic opportunity institute would recommend an additional consumer tax on espresso beverages, or any other single consumer product."" the city council has yet to decide when the initiative will go before voters next year. the initiative's authors say it is directed at vendors critics predict it will be passed on to consumers through higher prices, effectively punishing them for their choice of coffee. the tax would be applied to any drink with at least half an ounce of espresso, including decaf. drip coffee would be exempt. burbank says the tax would reach only a preselected group of consumers who are wealthier than those who drink drip. so, he's been pitching it as a modernday robin hood tax, where the needy get a dime every time the affluent spend $3 to $4 on an espresso. it's the kind of political marketing that fran beulah, 43, finds funny.

""but it's not, they are really out there."" 'cats with cubs' mr bamping said there have been reports of big cats from every corner of the country. big cat reports hotspots include scotland and gloucestershire january 2002  kent man clawed by suspected lynx november 2001  farmer reports animals mauled by big cat april 2001  lynx captured in north london 1999  pumalike cat attacks horse in wales ""this weekend alone i have had sightings from wales, the scottish borders, kent, the west midlands, devon, somerset and wiltshire,"" he said. the society claims some of the big cats are breeding with domestic animals. but mr bamping said others, particularly lynx and puma, probably exist in sufficient numbers to breed among themselves. ""we have had sightings of cats with cubs,"" he added. 'trigger camera' the society claims to have evidence proving the cats' existence, including photographs, paw prints, sheep kills and hair samples. but it knows it will have to do even more to convince a sceptical public that it is not spinning them a shaggy cat story. a national ""trigger camera"" project is planned which, the society hopes, will provide footage to prove the existence of the big cats. mr bamping said ""the idea is that the cat will walk past the camera and take a picture of itself."" 'like dogs' the society believes many of the sighting are of pets released into the wild, or their descendants. its spokesman danny nineham said ""in the 1960s and 1970s, people had big cats like leopards as pets and they used to walk them like dogs. ""but in 1976 when the dangerous wild animals act came into force, people released their cats because they did not want to pay for a licence, put them down, or take them to a zoo.""  yahoo! groups sponsor  4 dvds free sp join now  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to your use of yahoo! groups is subject to",[],2838,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""i have seen the microsite myself and it's very sophisticated,"" said the ncis spokesman. ""it's very convincing especially to people not very experienced online."" once the con was discovered it was quickly shut down. however, the people behind it have not been caught. ncis does know that at least two people have lost more than $100,000. the bank involved has bought up the domain used in the con as well as many other permutations of its name to limit the chance it could happen again. domain games usually people are first hooked in to what has become known as advanced fee or 419 fraud by replying to an unsolicited fax or email offering a share of any cash successfully moved out of africa. the '419' refers to the part of the nigerian penal code dealing with such crimes. like any con, there is no money to be moved at all and instead anyone taking the bait is asked to pay increasingly large sums to supposedly bribe uncooperative officials and to smooth the passage of the cash. although this con has been practiced for years, people still fall victim to it. ncis estimates that up to five americans are sitting in hotel lobbies in london everyday waiting to meet people connected with this con. cutting edge fraud often the conmen provide fake banking certificates to give the con an air of legitimacy. people tricked into clicking on fake sites but a spokesman for ncis said fake or spoof websites are now being used in place of the certificates. ""to many people nowadays the cutting edge of banking technology is web technology,"" said the spokesman. one of the first groups of conmen to use this method set up a fake website that supposedly gave victims access to accounts held at the south african reserve bank, the country's national bank. typically, victims are given a login name and password and are encouraged to visit the site so they can see that the cash they are getting a share of has been deposited in their name. but before they can get their hands on the cash, the victims are typically asked to hand over more of their own money to help the transfer go ahead. once the south african police discovered the ruse they declared it a national priority crime and soon arrested the 18 people behind it. modern gloss an briefing paper prepared by ncis in august on organised crime noted that criminals were increasingly turning to the web to lure new victims and give old cons a modern gloss. the ncis spokesman urged people who have fallen victim to 419 fraud to come forward and help it track down the perpetrators. he said in the last two months it had arrested 24 people overseas involved with this type of fraud. he said any email, fax or letter making an offer that looks to good too be true, undoubtedly is. one of the first companies to fall victim to website spoofing was net payment service paypal. conmen set up a fake site and asked people to visit and reenter their account and credit card details because paypal had lost the information. the website link included in the email looked legitimate but in fact directed people to a fake domain that gathered details for the conmen's personal use.  yahoo! groups sponsor  sell a home for top $  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to your use of yahoo! groups is subject to",[],4740,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""our vision is to build out an xmlaware infrastructure,"" kelly said. ""the xa35 is the first of a family."" kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the file size up to 20 times. this, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best alternative. in addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount importance in the world of xml. ""today's firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only,"" kelly said. ""a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall. firewalls are blind to xml today."" future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on security, especially as web services proliferate, kelly said. according to datapower, most existing solutions to offload xml processing are homegrown and done in software  an approach the company itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with regards to speed and security. after trying the software path, the company turned to creating a solution that would process xml in hardware. ""our xg3 execution core converts xml to machine code,"" said kelly, adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. kelly said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with technologies that claim to do xml processing  claims that he believes will be mostly false. other contentaware switches, such as ssl (secure socket layer) accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes of a packet, while the xa35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at 1,400 bytes and thus enabling greater processing of xml data, kelly explained. the 1uhigh network device has been tested against a large collection of xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the markup language as they pass through the device. the xa35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and will identify and process those packets that are xml, kelly said. in addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an application coprocessor. this deployment method gives administrators more granular control over what data is inspected and the application server itself controls the device. datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging market. startup sarvega, based in burr ridge, ill., introduced the sarvega xpe switch in may, and earlier this month tarari, an intel spinoff, launched with a focus on content processing and acceleration. the datapower device is now available, priced starting at $54,995. the company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in field trails at a number of other enterprises.  datapower has been addressing enterprise networking needs since it was founded in early 1999 by eugene kuznetsov, a technology visionary who foresaw the adverse effects xml and other next generation protocols would have on enterprise networks. long before industry interest in xml grew, kuznetsov assembled a team of worldclass m.i.t. engineers and designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique requirements for processing xml. the first such solution was a software interpreter called dgxt. this softwarebased approach to xml processing is still licensed by many companies for use in their own products today. leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from developing softwarebased accelerators, kuznetsov's team raised the bar and designed a system for processing xml in purposebuilt hardware. in 2001, datapower's effort produced xml generation three (xg3tm), the industry's fastest technology for xml processing, bar none. today, xg3tm technology powers the industry's first wirespeed xml network devices, enabling secure, highspeed applications and xml web services. while other companies are just now marketing first versions of products, datapower is delivering its third generation of technology, providing an immediate return on technology investments to industryleading customers and partners. datapower's m.i.t. heritage is complemented by a management team that brings decades of experience in the networking and computing industries, drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including akamai, argon, cascade, castle networks, sycamore and wellfleet.  datapower technology secures $9.5 million in funding venrock associates, mobius venture capital and seed capital back pioneer in xmlaware networking for web services cambridge, mass.  july 8, 2002  datapower technology, inc., the leading provider of xmlaware network infrastructure, today announced that it has secured $9.5 million in series b financing. investors for this round include venrock associates, mobius venture capital and seed capital partners. michael tyrrell, of venrock, bill burnham, of mobius, and jeff fagnan, of seed capital, have joined datapowers board of directors. datapower will use this funding to accelerate development, marketing and sales of the companys breakthrough technology for xmlaware networking. founded in 1999, datapower invented the worlds first intelligent xml networking devices, capable of transforming xml traffic and transactions at the wirespeed enterprises need to effectively embrace web services and other xmlcentric initiatives. datapowers solutions are based on its patentpending xml generation three (xg3tm) technology. ""enterprises are adopting xml at rapid rate to facilitate interand intracompany communications but their network infrastructure is ill prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type. datapowers xmlacceleration devices enable the wirespeed processing of xml that is required to support next generation enterprise applications,"" said eugene kuznetsov, cto and founder of datapower technology. ""datapower gives companies the ability to use xml thats critical to web services projects without sacrificing an ounce of performance."" a single datapower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10 serversbreaking the performance bottleneck associated with xml processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. in addition, the datapower platform provides enhanced xml security, protection against xmlbased denialofservice attacks, connection of ebusiness protocols for incompatible xml data streams, load balancing between backend servers and realtime statistics reports. ""in the postbubble economy, technology investment decisions require laserfocused scrutiny. datapowers patentpending technology addresses a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said michael tyrrell of venrock associates. ""by turbocharging their networks with datapowers unique xmlaware networking technology, companies will be free to adopt next generation web services without encountering performance and security pitfalls."" ""we looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing the rapidly growing problems surrounding xml message processing performance and security,"" said bill burnham of mobius venture capital. ""datapower is on their third generation of technology. their patent pending xml generation three (xg3) technology was quite simply the single most compelling technology solution we have seen to date."" ""xml is not a nicetohave, it is a must have for enterprises serious about optimizing application efficiency. since 1999, datapower has been developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of xml and web services,"" said jeff fagnan of seed capital partners. ""datapowers xmlacceleration devices are a key requirement for enterprises that rely on xml for mission critical applications."" about venrock associates venrock associates was founded as the venture

""i'm a woman and he just neglected to think that i would want it. the moose is gone, i know that now. i want to be compensated for the meat."" whether or not that happens is uncertain. her experience, though, highlights a law some mainers may not be aware of, but should get to know during this peak time of deerversuscar accidents, as the animals, in their mating season, come out of the woods. the law is simple a biggame carcass caught by a car  be it a moose, deer or bear  goes to the person who hits it, as long as a law enforcement officer is called to the scene and the vehicle is damaged in the accident. it comes up quite often in maine, say officials. last year, there were 4,055 cases of vehicles and deer colliding on maine roads and 600 accidents involving moose, according to mark latti, spokesman for the maine warden service. ""in a state of what, 1.4 million, with only 215,000 licensed hunters, i don't know how many motor vehicle drivers would know how to dress out a moose,"" said latti. ""you do have the option of keeping it."" which, for some people, can be valuable compensation for a damaged car. farmgrown deer meat can retail for $8 to $20 per pound in stores. and a butchered or dressed moose, which can't be bought or sold anywhere in maine, can produce hundreds of pounds of food. latti said when it comes to moose, the law has been abused since its inception in 1991. every now and then an officer will issue a summons to a driver for intentionally killing a moose with a car. that kind of ""hunting"" makes no sense to latti. hitting a moose, even at a slow speed, is no laughing matter. large adult moose can weigh up to 1,500 pounds and can be more than 9 feet tall. since the bulk of their weight is above the hood level of most cars, their bodies often come crashing through windshields in collisions. more often than not, crashes like these damage the vehicle, the people inside and the animal. sometimes they are fatal. in 1998, latti said, there were six mooserelated fatalities. after that, when the number of moosehunting permits went from 2,000 to 3,000, there were less. maine had three mooserelated fatalities in 2000, one in 2001 and two this year so far, said stephen mccausland, spokesman for the maine public safety department. pierce considers herself lucky that she and the three children in her car did not become part of that statistic early on election day. but she also feels cheated by the whole situation. after all, her car was totaled. on the morning of the accident, pierce was taking her two children and a neighbor's son to school in her 1991 dodge dynasty. she said she was going along at about 35 mph on a welltraveled road, when a moose came out of nowhere. ""by the time my brain could see moose, he was part of my windshield,"" she said. pierce is well aware of the law, so as she sat in the ambulance with the children, being treated for cuts and bruises, she thought about the moose. but the four of them were transferred to the hospital before she could deal with it, so she said she wasn't able to follow up on the animal until later that day. when she inquired, she was told the deputy on the scene gave the fullyracked bull moose to a neighbor who showed up with a tractor. her neighbor, she said, subsequently offered her the moose for the $100 it took him to carry it away, money she didn't think she should spend. by the time she contacted the attorney general's office on nov. 12 to complain about the deputy giving her moose away, the neighbor's price had gone up another $300 for the cost of butchering 450 pounds of meat. and when she called york county chief deputy maurice ouellette to complain that she should be compensated for the moose because it was the officer's fault that she didn't have it, ouellette told her he could not give her cash and the best he could do was to give her the next moose struck in york county. ""at that point in time it became an issue of not wanting moose anymore, but wanting money,"" ouellette said. that conversation, and a similar one she had with york county sheriff phil cote, left pierce enraged and she now feels the issue has gone beyond the moose. but the circumstances that brought her to this point are not surprising to other officials. ""it's the officer's discretion,"" said latti. ""and if the officer feels the person can't immediately remove (the animal), he's got to think of public safety and other people on the roadway. if someone is worried about her children in her car, the last thing a law enforcement officer wants to ask is if she wants the moose."" maine state police trooper jeremy forbes said when he arrives at accidents that involve a serious injury to a person, the issue of who gets the animal, deer or moose, becomes secondary. ""the priorities are the injuries and getting people to the hospital,"" he said. ""if they are really hurt and going to the hospital, the animal can't wait, so we'll probably give it to the next person who stops by."" this is not comforting to pierce. she said the deputy could have come to the ambulance and asked her what she wanted to do with the moose. with her boyfriend, a hunter, nearby, she could have easily taken care of the animal herself. she knows her situation is probably a lost cause. but she hopes other people, especially other women, do not have the same experience. ""what about people who don't know the law?"" she said. ""standing up for my rights has just been a big headache."" staff writer giselle goodman can be contacted at 3244888 or at to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to your use of yahoo! groups is subject to",[],6636,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(it is amazing what one can achieve when mains power fails, long enough for ups's to run out, and all that is left operational is the laptop and its battery supply...) first, i put in some defensive code into the area where the problem was occurring, so that if exmh is attempting (for any reason) to expand a sequence that isn't either a number, or a range of numbers (or a list of such things) it will simply ignore the trash, rather than giving a traceback. this one solves the initial problem  mh.tcl.was thu aug 22 211506 2002  mh.tcl wed aug 28 123911 2002  487,6 487,10  set seq  set rseq  foreach range split string trim $sequence   if !regexp 09(09)?$ $range    just ignore anything bogus  continue   set parts split string trim $range  if llength $parts  1  lappend seq $parts that is amending proc mhseqexpand which is where the error was occurring before (the code assumes that $range is either nnn or nnnmmm so we should probably make sure that's true  issue an error instead of just ""continue"" if you like, but i don't think an error is needed). but that just allowed me to create a similar problem, in another place, by typing ""nnn"" ... and rather than continue to fight fires like this, i thought i should think more about brent's suggestion. but rather than have the selection code actually validate the input, which would mean it would have to know what is to be valid, i decided that the right thing to do is just to ignore any errors caused by invalid input, so i just stuck a ""catch"" around the msgshow that is processing the nonsense that the user has typed. this way, any later expansion to what msgshow treats as legal (maybe allowing a sequence name, like ""prev"" or ""next"", or anything else can be handled just there, without someone needing to remember that they have to go fix the selection processing code to allow it. but, while i was playing there, i noticed something i never new before. if you type ""66"" the ""66"" changes to ""67"" (and so on, for each  that is typed). i suspect that's perhaps an artifact of "" is bound to a different function so it can be used as a toggle between changing the current and the target folder, but it has to mean something if the current input mode is a message number, so let it mean..."", but now i found it, i think its nice. but if we can type 66 why not 66 as well? that kind of limitation bugs me, so i fixed it. and then i wondered about folders with names containing ''  the special use of  as the toggle character means there's no way to type those from the keyboard. so i fixed that as well. this makes two different restrictions  there's no way to type a folder name that has a name beginning with '' (but such a thing in mh would be a pain to use anyway, so i doubt this will bother anyone), and it is now only possible to toggle between typing the current  target folder name when the name being typed is empty. i'm less happy about that part, but i think i can live with it in order to allow folder names with 's in them to exist and be typed. then, since i was there anyway, i decided to do something about another feature that has always bugged me. in ""normal"" keyboard mode, 's' is the key used to show a message. but if you've just typed 123, and the ftoc is highlighting 123 as the current message, and you want to now show that message, you can't type 's', you have to type r instead. so i ""fixed"" this one as well. ""fixed"" here is in quotes, as it assumes that the keybinding for msgshow is 's', if you change that to something else, it will remain 's' in here. i don't know enough tktcl to have it discover what key is bound to a function in the external world in order to bind the same one here. r continues to work of course. and now i got started in fixing irritants in this code, i also made it clear the status line if you abort messagefolder entry mode (c or g). previously it used to leave the prompt sitting there until the next message appeared, which made it less than obvious that the keyboard had reverted to its usual bindings. in any case, what follows is the patch that does all of that. i believe that if you apply this, then the one above is probably not needed, the ""catch"" around the ""msgshow"" will hide the problem (i don't think we really need to fix brent's way of invoking it). or include it anyway, just for completeness (i haven't run an exmh with the following patch, but not the previous one, so i don't know for sure that all will be ok then). kre  select.tcl.was thu aug 22 211507 2002  select.tcl wed aug 28 133617 2002  49,9 49,11  bindtags $w list $w entry bind $w anykey selecttypein %w %a bind $w keyplus selecttoggle %w   bind $w keyminus selectprev %w  bind $w space selectcomplete %w bind $w tab selectcomplete %w bind $w return selectreturn %w  bind $w keys selectreturn %w %a bind $w backspace selectbackspace %w bind $w controlh selectbackspace %w bind $w delete selectbackspace %w  72,7 74,7  append select(sel) $a exmhstatus ""$select(prompt) $select(sel)"" if !info exists select(folder)   msgchange $select(sel) noshow  catch  msgchange $select(sel) noshow    proc selectbackspace  w    91,6 93,10  proc selecttoggle w  global select if info exists select(folder)   if $select(sel) !

""i alb knew then there was something special."" alb moylan, 49, is one of thousands of men who use introduction agencies to meet alb  and marry  thai women. he lives in england now with 28yearold wan, alb who is expecting their first child. alb critics of marriage agencies say they exploit the grinding poverty of women alb in developing countries, offering dreams of a new life in the west that alb often turn sour. but moylan says he has no regrets about coming to thailand alb in search of a wife. alb ""i got to thailand at 2 p.m., and by 4 p.m. i'd met wan,"" he said. ""i knew i alb found her attractive. i could tell straight away that she was very caring."" alb moylan spent a week in thailand, and after returning to england kept in alb touch with wan by phone and mail. six months later she came to england and alb the couple married. alb mr. marriage alb lawrence lynch, 49, runs thai professional introduction services, the agency alb moylan used to meet his wife. lynch, who calls himself ""mr. marriage,"" alb started the company after also marrying a thai woman through an introduction alb agency. alb since then he has helped set up hundreds of marriages. alb ""in the last five years we've done about 400,"" he said. ""to the best of my alb knowledge, they have all been successful."" alb male clients pay $2,213 for the service, although men from countries that alb require them to handle some of the visa work on their own get a discount. alb clients then get to view catalogs and videos of hundreds of thai women alb looking for a husband. if they like what they see they come to bangkok. alb clients are introduced to several women in chaperoned meetings in lynch's alb office  encounters that can often be awkward given mutual shyness and alb language problems. alb ""we find that the gentlemen are usually just as nervous as the ladies,"" alb lynch said. ""but once they start meeting the ladies they soon relax."" alb after the first meeting, couples can decide to go on dates to get to know alb each other better. within two weeks of arrival, lynch says, almost every alb client has found a potential wife. alb ""at the end of a fortnight it's very, very rare for a guy to go back and alb think he hasn't made his mind up,"" he said. in most cases, marriage follows, alb usually within the next year. alb roongthip kamchat, managing director of thai no. 1 connections, a alb bangkokbased agency, says she has introduced about 1,000 couples, and less alb than 10 percent have broken up. alb roongthip says she sometimes has a difficult time calming men who have just alb arrived in bangkok looking for a wife. alb ""sometimes they are very nervous,"" she said. ""and sometimes they are very alb impatient and say 'give me a lady, i want to get married now.' i say 'calm alb down, ok, we'll talk.""' alb but if men are really in a hurry, roongthip says, she can find them a wife alb and get them married within a week. lynch says clients he has found wives alb for include a blind man, a man with one leg and a man with posttraumatic alb stress disorder. alb why? alb similar marriage agencies can be found in many developing countries. critics alb say they thrive on the neediness of lonely western men who are unable to alb form relationships in their own country, and on the desperation of alb impoverished women who believe they can find a better life in the west. alb but moylan says that if the arrangement makes both partners happy, there is alb no reason to object. ""if you talk about people who are needy, i think alb everybody wants someone to love them, and wants someone to love, so yes, i alb need wan,"" he said. alb ""thai women are dissatisfied with life in thailand. i think there's no alb secret there. they are looking for a better life. i don't have a problem alb with that. in return they are willing to give a lot of love and care to alb their future husband."" alb lynch says men are dissatisfied with western women too, and that is why they alb choose to use his agency. alb his brochure promises an alternative to the ""kind of defeminized, alb oversized, selfcentered, mercenaryminded lady available on the british alb singles scene,"" and says he can make dreams come true even for men who are alb not ""god's gift to women."" alb roongthip said many western men found it difficult to meet women in their alb own countries  and found thai women attractive. alb ""they don't know how to meet women. even if they go to pubs or discotheques alb or restaurants or department stores, how can they ask people to marry them? alb impossible,"" she said. alb ""many thai girls are slim, have long hair, black eyes, small nose. they are alb good at taking care and joking and laughing, not strict. different from alb ladies from other countries."" alb although many couples married through agencies have a considerable age gap, alb the agencies say this is not a problem. they say language problems are also alb not a major obstacle. alb ""thai ladies are not ageist, and they have no qualms whatsoever about having alb a husband who is significantly older,"" lynch said. ""when i met my wife she alb couldn't speak a word of english. we muddled along with a phonetic alb dictionary. the ladies are very keen to learn english and they pick it up alb very quickly."" alb many agencies also offer tuition for woman on what to expect when they move alb to the west. alb ""we have kitchens, we have study classes,"" roongthip said. ""we teach them alb how to eat, and when to make tea."" alb pitfalls alb but not all dreams come true. ""bee"" is a 26yearold thai woman who went to alb switzerland two years ago with a man she met through an agency. now she is alb back in bangkok, sad and angry. alb ""he had no friends, and i was so lonely,"" she said.

""i thought i would be happy alb there,"" she said. ""but it was the worst time of my life."" alb lynch says that while some agencies are badly run, he makes checks to ensure alb unsuitable candidates are weeded out. alb ""we are ethical and professional,"" he said. ""we will not take on all alb comers."" alb moylan says that despite possible pitfalls, his own marriage is proof the alb arrangement can work. wan's sister has just signed up with lynch's company, alb looking for a foreign husband. alb ""perhaps there are cases of women being exploited. i'm sure there are,"" alb moylan said.

Histor,we're trying to decide if fogbugz 3.0 should support custom fields. histor,"url date not supplied we're trying to decide if fogbugz1 3.0 should support custom fields. historically, i am opposed to custom fields in principle, because they get abused. people add so many fields to their bug databases to capture everything they think might be important that entering a bug is like applying to harvard. end result people don't enter bugs, which is much, much worse than not capturing all that information. you can always ""page fault"" to get the information if the original report forgot it. rather than having a field in every bug where you enter the version numbers of every dll on your machine (this is an actual customer request), information which is likely to be relevant only for a tiny percentage of bugs, why not just have the programmerassignee look at the bug first, and if they think it might be dllversionrelated, only then bounce the bug back to the originator asking for the dll info? similarly, it's always tempting to add a field in which you ask for the os version in which the bug occurred. this sounds logical, but trust me adding fields like this is guaranteed to do one thing and one thing only reduce the number of bug reports that get into the system in the first place. only a small percentage of bugs are really os dependant and you can always include that info in the text description of the bug if it happens to be relevant. (but then how do you search for, say, all bugs which only happen on windows 98se? aha! you can't. ever. even with the custom field. because not every bug has been regressed on every version of every operating system, so this search doesn't make sense in the first place. the info wasn't captured. do a full text search for 98se and you'll find some of them. life is imperfect.) life would be more perfect if every bug report included megabytes of information  a complete dump of every byte on the hard drive and in ram on the computer in question and while you're at it, a photograph of the tester's workspace. but the goal of a bug tracking database is to keep track of bugs, which, all else being equal, takes priority over making it easy to find them. i have heard countless stories of development teams where the bug tracking package was so highceremony that people were afraid to enter bugs in the system, because they didn't know what all those fields were. the real bug""tracking"" happened in email, postits, and hallway conversations. great. a pretty common question we get on the customer service line is, ""does fogbugz support custom fields?"" rather than giving our usual answer (""no. on purpose."") over the last few weeks i've been saying, ""can you please tell me what fields you would need? we're trying to decide whether to implement that feature in 3.0 and we want to know why people need it."" the interesting thing is, almost all of the fields people ask for are already in fogbugz, and the other ones, in my educated opinion, shouldn't be fields. and in fact, our existing customers are certainly happy without custom fields. one of our biggest site licenses was sold to a semiconductor company, and i myself wanted to add a custom field for them to keep track of versions of the circuit design, but i didn't, and they never needed it (even though they had been keeping track of it with the old bug tracking package which had custom fields), and they are happy and keep buying more site licenses. but the dilemma for us is that many customers are evaluating bug tracking software and they consider the lack of custom fields to be a major weakness in our product.

subject sed sunited statesroman empireg   a world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human   race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable.   absolutely correct. perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about  life on earth today.   the following is a fascinating document of official government policy  that bears close reading. it is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in  an imperfect world.    the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations. it does,   however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, a battle for the   future of the muslim world. this is a struggle of ideas and this is an   area where america must excel.   i was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of radio sawa,  our new musicandnews channel for 1530 year old arabs. it's 1 in  practically every market it's entered, nearing 90% listenership in  amman. and it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past bbc and  taking share from every other government broadcaster.   it is as hard to imagine america losing a war of ideas in the longterm  as it is to imagine america making any headway at all in the short term.   many of you may disagree, but i found the document below surprisingly  centrist. if you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re  icc, taiwan relations act, etc. but, still, this is as much a democratic  platform as not. africa and aids take up more mindshare than i feared  they might.   as you read, replace ""united states"" with ""roman empire"" and it may make  as much sense, in the long view of history. i don't know how proud to be  about that, but it is telling. sometime i daydream that the president  might sit down with the nation with perotista flip charts and explain to  our citizens the sheer vastness of our 700 military installations  overseas and what they do for us. it would be a powerful education on  how engaged we are in the world around us.   heck, i'd love to see a realtime map of federal expenditures around the  globe, a softly glowing necklace of embassies, carriers, arctic research  stations, hotels, golf courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all  the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy.   of course, this still doesn't leave me any more comfortable with the  real news in this document the bush doctrine for preemptive strikes.  i'd sooner repeal the church amendments on covert action than permit  such a principle to be loosed upon the world.   rohit     september 20, 2002   full text bush's national security strategy   following is the full text of president bush's new national security  strategy. the document, entitled ""the national security strategy of the  united states,"" will soon be transmitted to congress as a declaration of  the administration's policy.   introduction   the great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and  totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of  freedom  and a single sustainable model for national success freedom,  democracy, and free enterprise. in the twentyfirst century, only  nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and  guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the  potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. people  everywhere want to say what they think choose who will govern them  worship as they please educate their children  male and female own  property and enjoy the benefits of their labor. these values of freedom  are right and true for every person, in every society  and the duty of  protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of  freedomloving people across the globe and across the ages.   today, the united states enjoys a position of unparalleled military  strength and great economic and political influence. in keeping with our  heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for  unilateral advantage. we seek instead to create a balance of power that  favors human freedom conditions in which all nations and all societies  can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and  economic liberty. by making the world safer, we allow the people of the  world to make their own lives better. we will defend this just peace  against threats from terrorists and tyrants. we will preserve the peace  by building good relations among the great powers. we will extend the  peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent.   defending our nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental  commitment of the federal government. today, that task has changed  dramatically. enemies in the past needed great armies and great  industrial capabilities to endanger america. now, shadowy networks of  individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less  than it costs to purchase a single tank. terrorists are organized to  penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies  against us.   to defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal   from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and  cutting off terrorist financing. the war against terrorists of global  reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. america will help  nations that need our assistance in combating terror. and america will  hold to account nations that are compromised by terror  because the  allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. the united states and  countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop  new home bases. together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every  turn.   the gravest danger our nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism  and technology. our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking  weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing  so with determination. the united states will not allow these efforts to  succeed. we will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other  means of delivery. we will cooperate with other nations to deny,  contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous  technologies. and, as a matter of common sense and selfdefense, america  will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. we  cannot defend america and our friends by hoping for the best. so we must  be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence  and proceeding with deliberation. history will judge harshly those who  saw this coming danger but failed to act. in the new world we have  entered, the only path to safety is the path of action.   as we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic  opportunity to preserve the peace. today, the international community  has the best chance since the rise of the nationstate in the  seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace  instead of continually prepare for war. today, the world's great powers  find ourselves on the same side  united by common dangers of terrorist  violence and chaos. the united states will build on these common  interests to promote global security. we are also increasingly united by  common values. russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching  for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. chinese  leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of  national wealth. in time, they will find that social and political  freedom is the only source of national greatness. america will encourage  the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations,  because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and  international order. we will strongly resist aggression from other great  powers  even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity,  trade, and cultural advancement.   finally, the united states will use this moment of opportunity to extend  the benefits of freedom across the globe. we will actively work to bring  the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to  every corner of the world. the events of september 11, 2001, taught us  that weak states, like afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our  national interests as strong states. poverty does not make poor people  into terrorists and murderers. yet poverty, weak institutions, and  corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and  drug cartels within their borders.   the united states will stand beside any nation determined to build a  better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. free  trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies  out of poverty  so the united states will work with individual  nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to  build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity.  the united states will deliver greater development assistance through  the new millennium challenge account to nations that govern justly,  invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. we will also  continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of  aids and other infectious diseases.   in building a balance of power that favors freedom, the united states is  guided by the conviction that all nations have important  responsibilities. nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror.  nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the  spread of weapons of mass destruction. nations that seek international  aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. for  freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required.   we are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer,  better world alone. alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply  the strength of freedomloving nations. the united states is committed  to lasting institutions like the united nations, the world trade  organization, the organization of american states, and nato as well as  other longstanding alliances. coalitions of the willing can augment  these permanent institutions. in all cases, international obligations  are to be taken seriously. they are not to be undertaken symbolically to  rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment.   freedom is the nonnegotiable demand of human dignity the birthright of  every person  in every civilization. throughout history, freedom has  been threatened by war and terror it has been challenged by the  clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants and  it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. today, humanity  holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all  these foes. the united states welcomes our responsibility to lead in  this great mission.   i. overview of america's international strategy    ""our nation's cause has always been larger than our nation's defense. we  fight, as we always fight, for a just peace  a peace that favors  liberty. we will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists  and tyrants. we will preserve the peace by building good relations among  the great powers. and we will extend the peace by encouraging free and  open societies on every continent.""        president bush  west point, new york  june 1, 2002     the united states possesses unprecedented  and unequaled  strength  and influence in the world. sustained by faith in the principles of  liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with  unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. the great  strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that  favors freedom.   for most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great  struggle over ideas destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and  equality.   that great struggle is over. the militant visions of class, nation, and  race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and  discredited. america is now threatened less by conquering states than we  are by failing ones. we are menaced less by fleets and armies than by  catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. we must  defeat these threats to our nation, allies, and friends.   this is also a time of opportunity for america. we will work to  translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity,  and liberty. the u.s. national security strategy will be based on a  distinctly american internationalism that reflects the union of our  values and our national interests. the aim of this strategy is to help  make the world not just safer but better. our goals on the path to  progress are clear political and economic freedom, peaceful relations  with other states, and respect for human dignity.   and this path is not america's alone. it is open to all.   to achieve these goals, the united states will    champion aspirations for human dignity    strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent  attacks against us and our friends    work with others to defuse regional conflicts    prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our  friends, with weapons of mass destruction    ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and  free trade    expand the circle of development by opening societies and building  the infrastructure of democracy    develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of  global power and    transform america's national security institutions to meet the  challenges and opportunities of the twentyfirst century.    ii. champion aspirations for human dignity    ""some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the  language of right and wrong. i disagree. different circumstances require  different methods, but not different moralities.""       president bush  west point, new york  june 1, 2002     in pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we  stand for the united states must defend liberty and justice because  these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. no nation  owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. fathers and  mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live  free from poverty and violence. no people on earth yearn to be  oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of  the secret police.   america must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human  dignity the rule of law limits on the absolute power of the state  free speech freedom of worship equal justice respect for women  religious and ethnic tolerance and respect for private property.   these demands can be met in many ways. america's constitution has served  us well. many other nations, with different histories and cultures,  facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these  core principles into their own systems of governance. history has not  been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and  aspirations of their people.   our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. but even in  our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the declaration of  independence were there to guide us. as a result, america is not just a  stronger, but is a freer and more just society.   today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. and  when openings arrive, we can encourage change  as we did in central  and eastern europe between 1989 and 1991, or in belgrade in 2000. when  we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in taiwan or in  the republic of korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in latin  america and africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can  evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all  cherish.   embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today,  the national security strategy of the united states must start from  these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty.   our principles will guide our government's decisions about international  cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation  of resources. they will guide our actions and our words in international  bodies.   we will    speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of  human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to  advance freedom    use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who  struggle nonviolently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward  democracy are rewarded for the steps they take    make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key  themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation  from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights  to move toward a better future and    take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience  and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments.    we will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist  it.   iii. strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent  attacks against us and our friends    ""just three days removed from these events, americans do not yet have  the distance of history. but our responsibility to history is already  clear to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. war has been  waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. this nation is  peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. the conflict was begun on  the timing and terms of others. it will end in a way, and at an hour, of  our choosing.""       president bush  washington, d.c. (the national cathedral)  september 14, 2001     the united states of america is fighting a war against terrorists of  global reach. the enemy is not a single political regime or person or  religion or ideology. the enemy is terrorism  premeditated,  politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents.   in many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a  lasting peace. such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed  within a political process. but no cause justifies terror. the united  states will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals  with them. we make no distinction between terrorists and those who  knowingly harbor or provide aid to them.   the struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in  our history. it will be fought on many fronts against a particularly  elusive enemy over an extended period of time. progress will come  through the persistent accumulation of successes  some seen, some  unseen.   today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can,  and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to  achieve their political goals. afghanistan has been liberated coalition  forces continue to hunt down the taliban and alqaida. but it is not  only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. thousands of  trained terrorists remain at large with cells in north america, south  america, europe, africa, the middle east, and across asia.   our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist  organizations of global reach and attack their leadership command,  control, and communications material support and finances. this will  have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate.   we will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a  coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. once the regional  campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure  the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial  tools necessary to finish the task.   the united states will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the  financing of terrorism. we will identify and block the sources of  funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who  support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial  system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists,  and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative  financial networks.   however, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the  cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we  seek.   we will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by    direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and  international power. our immediate focus will be those terrorist  organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of  terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction  (wmd) or their precursors    defending the united states, the american people, and our interests  at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it  reaches our borders. while the united states will constantly strive to  enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate  to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of selfdefense by  acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing  harm against our people and our country and    denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists  by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign  responsibilities.    we will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international  terrorism. this includes    using the full influence of the united states, and working closely  with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are  illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as  slavery, piracy, or genocide behavior that no respectable government  can condone or support and all must oppose    supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the muslim  world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote  terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation    diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by  enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources  on areas most at risk and    using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of  information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of  those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism.    while we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also  strengthening america's homeland security to protect against and deter  attack.   this administration has proposed the largest government reorganization  since the truman administration created the national security council  and the department of defense. centered on a new department of homeland  security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental  reordering of the fbi, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland  encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public  and the private sector.   this strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. for example,  emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with  terrorism but with all hazards. our medical system will be strengthened  to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and  masscasualty dangers. our border controls will not just stop  terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic.   while our focus is protecting america, we know that to defeat terrorism  in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends.  wherever possible, the united states will rely on regional organizations  and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. where  governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we  will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and  our allies can provide.   as we pursue the terrorists in afghanistan, we will continue to work  with international organizations such as the united nations, as well as  nongovernmental organizations, and other countries to provide the  humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to  rebuild afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people,  threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists   in the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are  ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. freedom  and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this  conflict. in leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new,  productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in  ways that meet the challenges of the twentyfirst century.   iv. work with others to defuse regional conflicts    ""we build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion.  the magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements  look so small.""       president bush  berlin, germany  may 23, 2002     concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional  disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. in  an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our  alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create  horrifying affronts to human dignity. when violence erupts and states  falter, the united states will work with friends and partners to  alleviate suffering and restore stability.   no doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which u.s. action   direct or indirect  is warranted. we have finite political, economic,  and military resources to meet our global priorities. the united states  will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind    the united states should invest time and resources into building  international relationships and institutions that can help manage local  crises when they emerge.    the united states should be realistic about its ability to help  those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. where and when  people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively.    policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will  apply these principles   the israelipalestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of  human suffering, because of america's close relationship with the state  of israel and key arab states, and because of that region's importance  to other global priorities of the united states. there can be no peace  for either side without freedom for both sides. america stands committed  to an independent and democratic palestine, living beside israel in  peace and security. like all other people, palestinians deserve a  government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and  counts their votes. the united states will continue to encourage all  parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and  comprehensive settlement to the conflict.   the united states, the international donor community, and the world bank  stand ready to work with a reformed palestinian government on economic  development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to  establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. if  palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront  corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on american support  for the creation of a palestinian state.   israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic palestine.  permanent occupation threatens israel's identity and democracy. so the  united states continues to challenge israeli leaders to take concrete  steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible palestinian state.  as there is progress towards security, israel forces need to withdraw  fully to positions they held prior to september 28, 2000. and consistent  with the recommendations of the mitchell committee, israeli settlement  activity in the occupied territories must stop. as violence subsides,  freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent palestinians  to resume work and normal life. the united states can play a crucial  role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when israelis and  palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them.   in south asia, the united states has also emphasized the need for india  and pakistan to resolve their disputes. this administration invested  time and resources building strong bilateral relations with india and  pakistan. these strong relations then gave us leverage to play a  constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. with  pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by pakistan's  choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more  open and tolerant society. the administration sees india's potential to  become one of the great democratic powers of the twentyfirst century  and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. our  involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in  bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by india and pakistan  that can help defuse military confrontation.   indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and  respect for the rule of law. by tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting  the rule of law, and accepting open markets, indonesia may be able to  employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its  neighbors out of poverty and desperation. it is the initiative by  indonesia that allows u.s. assistance to make a difference.   in the western hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with  countries that share our priorities, particularly mexico, brazil,  canada, chile, and colombia. together we will promote a truly democratic  hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity,  opportunity, and hope. we will work with regional institutions, such as  the summit of the americas process, the organization of american states  (oas), and the defense ministerial of the americas for the benefit of  the entire hemisphere.   parts of latin america confront regional conflict, especially arising  from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. this conflict  and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and  security of the united states. therefore we have developed an active  strategy to help the andean nations adjust their economies, enforce  their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of  drugs, while  as important  we work to reduce the demand for drugs  in our own country.   in colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist  groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking  activities that help finance the operations of such groups. we are  working to help colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat  illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective  sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic  security to the colombian people.   in africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war,  and desperate poverty. this threatens both a core value of the united  states  preserving human dignity  and our strategic priority   combating global terror. american interests and american principles,  therefore, lead in the same direction we will work with others for an  african continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity.  together with our european allies, we must help strengthen africa's  fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous  borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence  infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists.   an ever more lethal environment exists in africa as local civil wars  spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. forming coalitions  of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to  confronting these emerging transnational threats.   africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that  focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. this  administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the  region    countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as south  africa, nigeria, kenya, and ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement  and require focused attention    coordination with european allies and international institutions is  essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace  operations and    africa's capable reforming states and subregional organizations  must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational  threats on a sustained basis.    ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the  surest route to progress in subsaharan africa, where most wars are  conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically  waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. the transition to  the african union with its stated commitment to good governance and a  common responsibility for democratic political systems offers  opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent.   v. prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our friends  with weapons of mass destruction    ""the gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and  technology. when the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear  weapons, along with ballistic missile technology  when that occurs,  even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to  strike great nations. our enemies have declared this very intention, and  have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. they want the  capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends  and  we will oppose them with all our power.""       president bush  west point, new york  june 1, 2002     the nature of the cold war threat required the united states  with our  allies and friends  to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of  force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. with the  collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war, our security  environment has undergone profound transformation.   having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our  relationship with russia, the dividends are evident an end to the  balance of terror that divided us an historic reduction in the nuclear  arsenals on both sides and cooperation in areas such as  counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were  inconceivable.   but new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists.  none of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power  that was arrayed against us by the soviet union. however, the nature and  motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain  destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest  states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass  destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex  and dangerous.   in the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue  states that, while different in important ways, share a number of  attributes. these states    brutalize their own people and squander their national resources  for the personal gain of the rulers    display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors,  and callously violate international treaties to which they are party    are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with  other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively  to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes    sponsor terrorism around the globe and    reject basic human values and hate the united states and everything  for which it stands.    at the time of the gulf war, we acquired irrefutable proof that iraq's  designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against  iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear  weapons and biological agents. in the past decade north korea has become  the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested  increasingly capable missiles while developing its own wmd arsenal.  other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as  well. these states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has  become a looming threat to all nations.   we must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients  before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction  against the united states and our allies and friends. our response must  take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new  partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military  forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective  missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence  collection and analysis.   our comprehensive strategy to combat wmd includes    proactive counterproliferation efforts. we must deter and defend  against the threat before it is unleashed. we must ensure that key  capabilities  detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce  capabilities  are integrated into our defense transformation and our  homeland security systems. counterproliferation must also be integrated  into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of  our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with wmdarmed  adversaries.    strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and  terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise  necessary for weapons of mass destruction. we will enhance diplomacy,  arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction  assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking wmd, and when  necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. we will  continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their  increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and  threat reduction programs. the recent g8 agreement to commit up to $20  billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step  forward.    effective consequence management to respond to the effects of wmd  use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. minimizing the effects of  wmd use against our people will help deter those who possess such  weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading  enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. the united states  must also be prepared to respond to the effects of wmd use against our  forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked.    it has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of  this new threat. given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the  united states can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have  in the past. the inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy  of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be  caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option.  we cannot let our enemies strike first.    in the cold war, especially following the cuban missile crisis, we  faced a generally status quo, riskaverse adversary. deterrence was an  effective defense. but deterrence based only upon the threat of  retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states  more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and  the wealth of their nations.    in the cold war, weapons of mass destruction were considered  weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who  used them. today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons  of choice. for rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and  military aggression against their neighbors. these weapons may also  allow these states to attempt to blackmail the united states and our  allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior  of rogue states. such states also see these weapons as their best means  of overcoming the conventional superiority of the united states.    traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a  terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the  targeting of innocents whose socalled soldiers seek martyrdom in death  and whose most potent protection is statelessness. the overlap between  states that sponsor terror and those that pursue wmd compels us to  action.    for centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer  an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves  against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. legal scholars  and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption  on the existence of an imminent threat  most often a visible  mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack.   we must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and  objectives of today's adversaries. rogue states and terrorists do not  seek to attack us using conventional means. they know such attacks would  fail. instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use  of weapons of mass destruction  weapons that can be easily concealed  and delivered covertly and without warning.   the targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian  population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law  of warfare. as was demonstrated by the losses on september 11, 2001,  mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and  these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired  and used weapons of mass destruction.   the united states has long maintained the option of preemptive actions  to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. the greater the  threat, the greater is the risk of inaction  and the more compelling  the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if  uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. to  forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the united  states will, if necessary, act preemptively.   the united states will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging  threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression.  yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek  the world's most destructive technologies, the united states cannot  remain idle while dangers gather.   we will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our  actions. to support preemptive options, we will    build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide  timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge    coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the  most dangerous threats and    continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to  conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results.    the purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat  to the united states or our allies and friends. the reasons for our  actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just.   vi. ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and  free trade.    ""when nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a  privileged few, no amount  no amount  of development aid is ever  enough. when nations respect their people, open markets, invest in  better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade  revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively.""       president bush  monterrey, mexico  march 22, 2002     a strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing  prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. economic growth  supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher  incomes. it allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs  economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it  reinforces the habits of liberty.   we will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond america's  shores. all governments are responsible for creating their own economic  policies and responding to their own economic challenge. we will use our  economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of  policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic  growth, including    progrowth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business  investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity    tax policies  particularly lower marginal tax rates  that  improve incentives for work and investment    rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are  confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic  endeavors    strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most  efficient use    sound fiscal policies to support business activity    investments in health and education that improve the wellbeing and  skills of the labor force and population as a whole and    free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the  diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and  opportunity.    the lessons of history are clear market economies, not  commandandcontrol economies with the heavy hand of government, are the  best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. policies that further  strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for  all economies  industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the  developing world.   a return to strong economic growth in europe and japan is vital to u.s.  national security interests. we want our allies to have strong economies  for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake  of global security. european efforts to remove structural barriers in  their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are  japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of  nonperforming loans in the japanese banking system. we will continue to  use our regular consultations with japan and our european partners   including through the group of seven (g7)  to discuss policies they  are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher  global economic growth.   improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic  growth. international flows of investment capital are needed to expand  the productive potential of these economies. these flows allow emerging  markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise  living standards and reduce poverty. our longterm objective should be a  world in which all countries have investmentgrade credit ratings that  allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in  their future.   we are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve  access to larger capital flows at lower cost. to this end, we will  continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial  markets. we will work actively with other countries, the international  monetary fund (imf), and the private sector to implement the g7 action  plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and  more effectively resolving them when they occur.   the best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from  occurring, and we have encouraged the imf to improve its efforts doing  so. we will continue to work with the imf to streamline the policy  conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on  achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy,  exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy.   the concept of ""free trade"" arose as a moral principle even before it  became a pillar of economics. if you can make something that others  value, you should be able to sell it to them. if others make something  that you value, you should be able to buy it. this is real freedom, the  freedom for a person  or a nation  to make a living. to promote free  trade, the unites states has developed a comprehensive strategy    seize the global initiative. the new global trade negotiations we  helped launch at doha in november 2001 will have an ambitious agenda,  especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for  completion in 2005. the united states has led the way in completing the  accession of china and a democratic taiwan to the world trade  organization. we will assist russia's preparations to join the wto.    press regional initiatives. the united states and other democracies  in the western hemisphere have agreed to create the free trade area of  the americas, targeted for completion in 2005. this year the united  states will advocate marketaccess negotiations with its partners,  targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and  government procurement. we will also offer more opportunity to the  poorest continent, africa, starting with full use of the preferences  allowed in the african growth and opportunity act, and leading to free  trade.    move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. building on the  free trade agreement with jordan enacted in 2001, the administration  will work this year to complete free trade agreements with chile and  singapore. our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of  developed and developing countries in all regions of the world.  initially, central america, southern africa, morocco, and australia will  be our principal focal points.    renew the executivecongressional partnership. every  administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with  congress. after a gap of 8 years, the administration reestablished  majority support in the congress for trade liberalization by passing  trade promotion authority and the other market opening measures for  developing countries in the trade act of 2002. this administration will  work with congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade  agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed trade  promotion authority.    promote the connection between trade and development. trade  policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights,  competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open  societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional  integration  all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in  developing countries. the united states is implementing the africa  growth and opportunity act to provide marketaccess for nearly all goods  produced in the 35 countries of subsaharan africa. we will make more  use of this act and its equivalent for the caribbean basin and continue  to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer  countries take advantage of these opportunities. beyond market access,  the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public  health. we will ensure that the wto intellectual property rules are  flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical  medicines for extraordinary dangers like hivaids, tuberculosis, and  malaria.    enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices.  commerce depends on the rule of law international trade depends on  enforceable agreements. our top priorities are to resolve ongoing  disputes with the european union, canada, and mexico and to make a  global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations  that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. laws  against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international  community must be able to address genuine concerns about government  subsidies and dumping. international industrial espionage which  undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.    help domestic industries and workers adjust. there is a sound  statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used  in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the  american steel industry. the benefits of free trade depend upon the  enforcement of fair trading practices. these safeguards help ensure that  the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of american  workers. trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the  change and dynamism of open markets.    protect the environment and workers. the united states must foster  economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with  widening prosperity. we will incorporate labor and environmental  concerns into u.s. trade negotiations, creating a healthy ""network""  between multilateral environmental agreements with the wto, and use the  international labor organization, trade preference programs, and trade  talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.    enhance energy security. we will strengthen our own energy security  and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our  allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and  types of global energy supplied, especially in the western hemisphere,  africa, central asia, and the caspian region. we will also continue to  work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient  technologies.    economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize  greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing  them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the  global climate. our overall objective is to reduce america's greenhouse  gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such  emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10  years, by the year 2012. our strategies for attaining this goal will be  to    remain committed to the basic u.n. framework convention for  international cooperation    obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of  the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to  companies that can show real cuts    develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission  reductions    promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as  well as nuclear power  which produces no greenhouse gas emissions,  while also improving fuel economy for u.s. cars and trucks    increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to  a total of $4.5 billion  the largest sum being spent on climate change  by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's  budget and    assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas  emitters such as china and india, so that they will have the tools and  resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and  better path.    vii. expand the circle of development by opening societies and building  the infrastructure of democracy    ""in world war ii we fought to make the world safer, then worked to  rebuild it. as we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we  must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens.""       president bush  washington, d.c. (interamerican  development bank)  march 14, 2002     a world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human  race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. including  all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development  and  opportunity  is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of  u.s. international policy.   decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic  growth in the poorest countries. worse, development aid has often served  to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and  perpetuating misery. results of aid are typically measured in dollars  spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction  achieved by recipients. these are the indicators of a failed strategy.   working with other nations, the united states is confronting this  failure. we forged a new consensus at the u.n. conference on financing  for development in monterrey that the objectives of assistance  and  the strategies to achieve those objectives  must change.   this administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential  of individuals in all nations. sustained growth and poverty reduction is  impossible without the right national policies. where governments have  implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels  of assistance. the united states and other developed countries should  set an ambitious and specific target to double the size of the world's  poorest economies within a decade.   the united states government will pursue these major strategies to  achieve this goal    provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of  national reform. we propose a 50 percent increase in the core  development assistance given by the united states. while continuing our  present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone,  these billions of new dollars will form a new millennium challenge  account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest  in their people, and encourage economic freedom. governments must fight  corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest  in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and  enable entrepreneurship. the millennium challenge account will reward  countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those  that have not to implement reforms.    improve the effectiveness of the world bank and other development  banks in raising living standards. the united states is committed to a  comprehensive reform agenda for making the world bank and the other  multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of  the world's poor. we have reversed the downward trend in u.s.  contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the u.s.  contributions to the international development association (ida)  the  world bank's fund for the poorest countries  and the african  development fund. the key to raising living standards and reducing  poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially  in the poorest countries. we will continue to press the multilateral  development banks to focus on activities that increase economic  productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law,  and private sector development. every project, every loan, every grant  must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in  developing countries.    insist upon measurable results to ensure that development  assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's  poor. when it comes to economic development, what really matters is that  more children are getting a better education, more people have access to  health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a  better future for their families. we have a moral obligation to measure  the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering  results. for this reason, we will continue to demand that our own  development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral  development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for  achieving those goals. thanks to u.s. leadership, the recent ida  replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation  system that measures recipient countries' progress. for the first time,  donors can link a portion of their contributions to ida to the  achievement of actual development results, and part of the u.s.  contribution is linked in this way. we will strive to make sure that the  world bank and other multilateral development banks build on this  progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything  that these institutions do.    increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in  the form of grants instead of loans. greater use of resultsbased grants  is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments,  particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with  everlarger debt burdens. as a result of u.s. leadership, the recent ida  agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the  poorest countries for education, hivaids, health, nutrition, water,  sanitation, and other human needs. our goal is to build on that progress  by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development  banks. we will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private  sector to match government efforts by using grants to support  development projects that show results.    open societies to commerce and investment. trade and investment are  the real engines of economic growth. even if government aid increases,  most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and  foreign investment. an effective strategy must try to expand these flows  as well. free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national  security strategy.    secure public health. the scale of the public health crisis in poor  countries is enormous. in countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics  like hivaids, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be  threatened until these scourges can be contained. resources from the  developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest  governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective  local infrastructure. the united states has strongly backed the new  global fund for hivaids organized by u.n. secretary general kofi annan  and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for  treatment and care. the united states already contributes more than  twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. if the  global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.    emphasize education. literacy and learning are the foundation of  democracy and development. only about 7 percent of world bank resources  are devoted to education. this proportion should grow. the united states  will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20  percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher  training in africa. the united states can also bring information  technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been  devastated by aids.    continue to aid agricultural development. new technologies,  including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields  in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water.  using sound science, the united states should help bring these benefits  to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still  suffer from hunger and malnutrition.    viii. develop agendas for cooperative action with the other main centers  of global power    ""we have our best chance since the rise of the nationstate in the 17th  century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead  of prepare for war.""       president bush  west point, new york  june 1, 2002     america will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions  as  broad as practicable  of states able and willing to promote a balance  of power that favors freedom. effective coalition leadership requires  clear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent  consultations among partners with a spirit of humility.   there is little of lasting consequence that the united states can  accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies  and friends in canada and europe. europe is also the seat of two of the  strongest and most able international institutions in the world the  north atlantic treaty organization (nato), which has, since its  inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and intereuropean  security, and the european union (eu), our partner in opening world  trade.   the attacks of september 11 were also an attack on nato, as nato itself  recognized when it invoked its article v selfdefense clause for the  first time. nato's core mission  collective defense of the  transatlantic alliance of democracies  remains, but nato must develop  new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new  circumstances. nato must build a capability to field, at short notice,  highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to  respond to a threat against any member of the alliance.   the alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened,  creating coalitions under nato's own mandate, as well as contributing to  missionbased coalitions. to achieve this, we must    expand nato's membership to those democratic nations willing and  able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests    ensure that the military forces of nato nations have appropriate  combat contributions to make in coalition warfare    develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become  effective multinational fighting forces    take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of  scale in our defense spending to transform nato military forces so that  they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities    streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to  meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of  training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations  and    maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as  we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces.    if nato succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a  partnership as central to the security and interests of its member  states as was the case during the cold war. we will sustain a common  perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to  take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. at the  same time, we welcome our european allies' efforts to forge a greater  foreign policy and defense identity with the eu, and commit ourselves to  close consultations to ensure that these developments work with nato. we  cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of  transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come.   the attacks of september 11 energized america's asian alliances.  australia invoked the anzus treaty to declare the september 11 was an  attack on australia itself, following that historic decision with the  dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for operation  enduring freedom. japan and the republic of korea provided unprecedented  levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist  attack. we have deepened cooperation on counterterrorism with our  alliance partners in thailand and the philippines and received  invaluable assistance from close friends like singapore and new zealand.   the war against terrorism has proven that america's alliances in asia  not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and  ready to deal with new challenges. to enhance our asian alliances and  friendships, we will     look to japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and  global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our  close defense and diplomatic cooperation    work with south korea to maintain vigilance towards the north while  preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of  the region over the longerterm    build on 50 years of u.s.australian alliance cooperation as we  continue working together to resolve regional and global problems  as  we have so many times from the battle of leyte gulf to tora bora    maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our  allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic  environment and    build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with  institutions such as asean and the asiapacific economic cooperation  forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage  change in this dynamic region.    we are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power  competition. several potential great powers are now in the midst of  internal transition  most importantly russia, india, and china. in all  three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly  global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape.   with russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based  on a central reality of the twentyfirst century the united states and  russia are no longer strategic adversaries. the moscow treaty on  strategic reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a  critical change in russian thinking that promises to lead to productive,  longterm relations with the euroatlantic community and the united  states. russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their  country's current weakness and the policies  internal and external   needed to reverse those weaknesses. they understand, increasingly, that  cold war approaches do not serve their national interests and that  russian and american strategic interests overlap in many areas.   united states policy seeks to use this turn in russian thinking to  refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and  challenges. we are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the  global war on terrorism. we are facilitating russia's entry into the  world trade organization, without lowering standards for accession, to  promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. we have  created the natorussia council with the goal of deepening security  cooperation among russia, our european allies, and ourselves. we will  continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the  former soviet union in the belief that a prosperous and stable  neighborhood will reinforce russia's growing commitment to integration  into the euroatlantic community.   at the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still  divide us from russia and about the time and effort it will take to  build an enduring strategic partnership. lingering distrust of our  motives and policies by key russian elites slows improvement in our  relations. russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of freemarket  democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons  of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. russia's very  weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. nevertheless, those  opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years  or even  decades.   the united states has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral  relationship with india based on a conviction that u.s. interests  require a strong relationship with india. we are the two largest  democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative  government. india is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. we  have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through  the vital sea lanes of the indian ocean. finally, we share an interest  in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable asia.   differences remain, including over the development of india's nuclear  and missile programs, and the pace of india's economic reforms. but  while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about  india, today we start with a view of india as a growing world power with  which we have common strategic interests. through a strong partnership  with india, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic  future.   the united states relationship with china is an important part of our  strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous asiapacific  region. we welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous  china. the democratic development of china is crucial to that future.  yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst  features of the communist legacy, china's leaders have not yet made the  next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state.  in pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its  neighbors in the asiapacific region, china is following an outdated  path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national  greatness. in time, china will find that social and political freedom is  the only source of that greatness.   the united states seeks a constructive relationship with a changing  china. we already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including  the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the korean  peninsula. likewise, we have coordinated on the future of afghanistan  and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counterterrorism and  similar transitional concerns. shared health and environmental threats,  such as the spread of hivaids, challenge us to promote jointly the  welfare of our citizens.   addressing these transnational threats will challenge china to become  more open with information, promote the development of civil society,  and enhance individual human rights. china has begun to take the road to  political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting  villagelevel elections, yet remains strongly committed to national  oneparty rule by the communist party. to make that nation truly  accountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work  remains to be done. only by allowing the chinese people to think,  assemble, and worship freely can china reach its full potential.   our important trade relationship will benefit from china's entry into  the world trade organization, which will create more export  opportunities and ultimately more jobs for american farmers, workers,  and companies. china is our fourth largest trading partner, with over  $100 billion in annual twoway trade. the power of market principles and  the wto's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance  openness and the rule of law in china to help establish basic  protections for commerce and for citizens. there are, however, other  areas in which we have profound disagreements. our commitment to the  selfdefense of taiwan under the taiwan relations act is one. human  rights is another. we expect china to adhere to its nonproliferation  commitments. we will work to narrow differences where they exist, but  not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree.   the events of september 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for  relations between the united states and other main centers of global  power, and opened vast, new opportunities. with our longstanding allies  in europe and asia, and with leaders in russia, india, and china, we  must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships  become routine and unproductive.   every agency of the united states government shares the challenge. we  can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober  analysis, and common action. in the longterm, these are the practices  that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open  the path of progress.   ix. transform america's national security institutions to meet the  challenges and opportunities of the twentyfirst century    ""terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity. they did not touch  its source. america is successful because of the hard work, creativity,  and enterprise of our people.""       president bush  washington, d.c. (joint session of congress)  september 20, 2001     the major institutions of american national security were designed in a  different era to meet different requirements. all of them must be  transformed.   it is time to reaffirm the essential role of american military strength.  we must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. our military's  highest priority is to defend the united states. to do so effectively,  our military must    assure our allies and friends    dissuade future military competition    deter threats against u.s. interests, allies, and friends and    decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails.    the unparalleled strength of the united states armed forces, and their  forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most  strategically vital regions. however, the threats and enemies we must  confront have changed, and so must our forces. a military structured to  deter massive cold warera armies must be transformed to focus more on  how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might  occur. we will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational  challenges.   the presence of american forces overseas is one of the most profound  symbols of the u.s. commitments to allies and friends. through our  willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others,  the united states demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of  power that favors freedom. to contend with uncertainty and to meet the  many security challenges we face, the united states will require bases  and stations within and beyond western europe and northeast asia, as  well as temporary access arrangements for the longdistance deployment  of u.s. forces.   before the war in afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major  planning contingencies. yet, in a very short time, we had to operate  across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch  of the armed forces. we must prepare for more such deployments by  developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, longrange precision  strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces.  this broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the  ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure  u.s. access to distant theaters, and protect critical u.s.  infrastructure and assets in outer space.   innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new  approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting u.s.  intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and  technology. we must also transform the way the department of defense is  run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention.  finally, while maintaining nearterm readiness and the ability to fight  the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the president with a  wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of  coercion against the united states, our allies, and our friends.   we know from history that deterrence can fail and we know from  experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. the united states must  and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy   whether a state or nonstate actor  to impose its will on the united  states, our allies, or our friends. we will maintain the forces  sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. our forces  will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a  military buildup in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the  united states.   intelligence  and how we use it  is our first line of defense  against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. designed  around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive,  fixed object  the soviet bloc  the intelligence community is coping  with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of  targets.   we must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to  keep pace with the nature of these threats. intelligence must be  appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems  and coordinated with our allies and friends. we need to protect the  capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the  knowledge of how best to surprise us. those who would harm us also seek  the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and  to maximize injury.   we must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide  integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. since  the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted  inside the united states, we must also ensure the proper fusion of  information between intelligence and law enforcement.   initiatives in this area will include    strengthening the authority of the director of central intelligence  to lead the development and actions of the nation's foreign intelligence  capabilities    establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides  seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing  the nation and our allies    continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to  sustain our intelligence advantage    investing in future capabilities while working to protect them  through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence  capabilities and    collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the  government with allsource analysis.    as the united states government relies on the armed forces to defend  america's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other  nations. we will ensure that the department of state receives funding  sufficient to ensure the success of american diplomacy. the state  department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with  other governments. and in this new era, its people and institutions must  be able to interact equally adroitly with nongovernmental organizations  and international institutions. officials trained mainly in  international politics must also extend their reach to understand  complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public  health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy.   our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil  wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. as humanitarian relief  requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build  police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial  government institutions, and electoral systems. effective international  cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by american  readiness to play our part.   just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out  to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to  public information efforts that can help people around the world learn  about and understand america. the war on terrorism is not a clash of  civilizations. it does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization,  a battle for the future of the muslim world. this is a struggle of ideas  and this is an area where america must excel.   we will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet  our global security commitments and protect americans are not impaired  by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the  international criminal court (icc), whose jurisdiction does not extend  to americans and which we do not accept. we will work together with  other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and  cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral  agreements that will protect u.s. nationals from the icc. we will  implement fully the american servicemembers protection act, whose  provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of u.s.  personnel and officials.   we will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the  right level and allocation of government spending on national security.  the united states government must strengthen its defenses to win this  war. at home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for  the american people.   today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is  diminishing. in a globalized world, events beyond america's borders have  a greater impact inside them. our society must be open to people, ideas,  and goods from across the globe. the characteristics we most cherish   our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life  are  vulnerable to terrorism. this vulnerability will persist long after we  bring to justice those responsible for the september eleventh attacks.  as time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that  until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. this  is a new condition of life. we will adjust to it and thrive  in spite  of it.   in exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and  interests of our friends and partners. still, we will be prepared to act  apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. when we  disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for  our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. we will not allow  such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with  our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values.   ultimately, the foundation of american strength is at home. it is in the  skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of  our institutions. a diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious,  entrepreneurial energy. our strength comes from what we do with that  energy. that is where our national security begins.",[],88035,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""i was afraid there was going to be a gun battle in that pressurized cabin,"" said senior judge james a. lineberger of the philadelphia court of common pleas, a veteran of 20 years in the military, who was sitting in an aisle seat in coach. ""i was afraid that i was going to die from the gunfire in a shootout."" dr. rajcoomar's wife, dorothy, who was seated quite a distance from her husband, said, ""it was really like rambo in the air."" she worried that there might be people on the plane who did not speak english, and therefore did not understand the marshals' orders. if someone got up to go to the bathroom, he or she might be shot. there were no terrorists on board. there was no threat of any kind. when the plane landed about half an hour later, mr. feuer was taken into custody. and then, shockingly, so was dr. rajcoomar. the air marshals grabbed the doctor from behind, handcuffed him and, for no good reason that anyone has been able to give, hauled him to an airport police station where he was thrown into a filthy cell. this was airline security gone berserk. no one ever suggested that dr. rajcoomar, a straightarrow retired army major, had done anything wrong. dr. rajcoomar, who is of indian descent, said he believes he was taken into custody solely because of his brown skin. he was held for three frightening hours and then released without being charged. mr. feuer was also released. officials tried to conceal the names of the marshals, but they were eventually identified by a philadelphia inquirer reporter as shawn b. mccullers and samuel mumma of the transportation security administration, which is part of the u.s. transportation department. the transportation security administration has declined to discuss the incident in detail. a spokesman offered the absurd explanation that dr. rajcoomar was detained because he had watched the unfolding incident ""too closely."" if that becomes a criterion for arrest in the u.s., a lot of us reporters are headed for jail. dr. rajcoomar told me yesterday that he remains shaken by the episode. ""i had never been treated like that in my life,"" he said. ""i was afraid that i was about to be beaten up or killed."" lawyers for the american civil liberties union have taken up his case and he has filed notice that he may sue the federal government for unlawful detention.

Habeus -- Why?,re satalk o.t. habeus  why?,"guys, the habeas infringers list (hil) exists explicitly to deal with spammers while we're getting judgments against them and especially in other countries, where those judgments are harder to get. please note that nobody has ever had an incentive before to go after regular spammers. yes, some attorneys general have prosecuted blatant pyramid schemes, and isps have won some theft of service suits, but the vast majority of spammers go forward with out any legal hassles. so, i can't understand how daniel can assert that you can't track spammers down when it's never really been tried. we can subpoena the records of the business they spammed on behalf of. we can subpoena the records of the isp that provided them service, and of the credit card they used for the whackamole accounts. we can use private investigators. yes, these people are often lowlifes (chickenboners). but, they're not secret agents. they're just trying to make a buck, and habeas' whole business is about finding them and putting them out of business habeas has the incentive to pursue spammers (that use our warrant mark) in a way that no one ever has had before. given that our whole business plan relies on habeas becoming synonymous with ""not spam"", i can't understand why you would assume ahead of time that we will be unsuccessful, plan for that failure, and in so doing, remove the potential of success, which is antispam filters like sa acting on the habeas warrant mark. daniel, it's easy enough for you to change the habeas scores yourself on your installation. if habeas fails to live up to its promise to only license the warrant mark to nonspammers and to place all violators on the hil, then i have no doubt that justin and craig will quickly remove us from the next release. but, you're trying to kill habeas before it has a chance to show any promise. at the end of the day, spamassassin is like the club, in that it encourages thieves (spammers) to just go after the next car (those without sa) rather than yours. habeas can play the role of lojack (the transmitter), in enabling the apprehension of thieves so that they don't steal any more cars. but only if we're given a chance to succeed.  dan  dan kohn  tel16503272600 original message from daniel quinlan sent wednesday, august 28, 2002 1638 to matthew cline cc subject re satalk o.t. habeus  why? matthew cline writes  there must be some way of tracking a spammer down, since they are  planning on making money from the spam. what a court would consider  evidence of being the spammer is another question. haha!!! just a few notes  it will be difficult to find, prosecute, and win money from someone in various nonfriendly countries where spam originates (china is a good example) even if they do officially ""respect"" copyright law.  law suits take time. between now and conclusion of the first court case, we could have years of spam in our mail boxes!  contact information can change phone numbers, po boxes, stolen cell phones, temporary email addresses, etc.  spammers do not always remember to include contact information! i don't understand it either, but nobody said they were bright. also, some spam is noncommercial or sent by a thirdparty (for example, ""pump and dump"" stock scams), so contact information is not strictly required for the spammer to get their way. dan  this sf.net email is sponsored by jabber  the world's fastest growing realtime communications platform! don't just im. build it in!  spamassassintalk mailing list  this sf.net email is sponsored by jabber  the world's fastest growing realtime communications platform! don't just im. build it in!  spamassassintalk mailing list",[],4415,0,0,easy_ham_testing

i knew you could... given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school, like, say, mine, ), is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a governmentrun ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of those on the forbes 400 as well as time goes on. if we ever get around to having a good old fashioned governmentcollapsing transferpayment depression (an economic version of this summer's governmentforest conflagration, caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clearcutting enough forests did out west this summer )) that should motivate more than a few erstslackers out there, including me, ), to learn to actually feed themselves. the next category on the forbes 400 list is someone with a ""terminal"" professional degree, like an mba, phd, md, etc., from the best school possible. why? because, as of about 1950, the best way to get into harvard, for instance, is to be smart, not rich. don't take my word for it, ask their admissions office. look at the admissions stats over the years for proof. meritocracy, american style, was invented at the ivy league after world war ii. even stanford got the hint, ), and, of course, chicago taught them all how, right? ). practically nobody who goes to a top20 american institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days. unless, of course, their parents, who couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the last 40 years or so. and their kids still had to get the grades, and ""biased"" (by intelligence )), test scores, to get in. the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal"" degrees, until they actually own something and hire people, or learn to make something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone is smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow. btw, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame me for the fact that i'm using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. you were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. i went to missouri, and i don't have a degree in anything actually useful, much less a ""terminal"" one, which means i'm broker than anyone on this list  it's just that you, of all people, lots with educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. the facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and look. there are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and economics is not a zerosum game. the cost of anything, including ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case, intelligence and effort. i will, however, admit to being educated waay past my level of competence, and, by the way you discuss economics, so have you, apparently. btw, if we ever actually had free markets in this country, including the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes, all those smart people in the forbes 400 would have more money, and there would be more selfmade people on that list. in addition, most of the people who inherited money on the list would have much less of it, not even relatively speaking. finally, practically all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not. that efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in the people's republics of berkeley or cambridge. it means more and better stuff, cheaper, over time  a terrible, petitbourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd know about it by now. in economic terms, it's also called an increase in general welfare, and, no, virginia, i'm not talking about extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as santa claus come election time... in short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just that horseshit, happy or otherwise. to believe otherwise, is  quite literally, given the time marx wrote capital and the manifesto  romantic nonsense. cheers, rah begin pgp signature version pgp 7.5 iqaawubpy511cpxh8jf3ohaeqlasgcfzhsqmsvuy6gqj5wgl52dwzkpihmanrur yybocicylp5tlkl58jpwefu z877 end pgp signature   r. a. hettinga mailto the internet bearer underwriting corporation  44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa ""... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, predicting the end of the world has not been found agreeable to experience.""  edward gibbon, 'decline and fall of the roman empire'",[],5532,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(by ""primitive expression"", i don't mean to slight any society, but that there is some chronic evidence of irrational mob actions and uncivilized behavior (killing infants, women to break religious blue laws, etc.). the us has only really been mostly free of ""primitive expression"" for 4050 years, although large categories, including serious religious conflict, were settled quite a while ago.) d) the northern ireland protestant vs. catholic feud, recently more or less concluded, is not completely unlike this kind of friction generated by splitting society too much along religious lines. one post article pointed out that the problem basically stemmed from the vertical integration of areas along religious lines all the way to schools, government, political party, etc. (of course both cases have a heritage of british conquest, but who doesn't?) (i couldn't find the article i remember, but here are a couple of others) 'northern ireland is a british province of green valleys and cloudcovered hills whose 1.6 million people are politically and religiously divided. about 54 percent of the population is protestant, and most protestants are unionists who want the province to remain part of britain. the roman catholic minority is predominantly republican, or nationalist they want to merge with the republic of ireland to the south. in 1968, catholic leaders launched a civil rights drive modeled on the rev. martin luther king jr.'s campaign in the american south. but violence quickly broke out, with ancient religious animosities fueling the political argument. armed paramilitary groups sprung up on both sides. police records and historians agree that the most lethal group by far was the ira, fighting on the catholic side with a goal of a united ireland the provincial police force estimates that about 3,600 people were killed during the 30year conflict known, with characteristic northern ireland understatement, as ""the troubles.""' 2. the us is trying to avoid making war on the muslim religion.  that's fine, as it would be an inappropriate concentration. it would be difficult to address the issues raised here in a clean way. i'd be happy with an acknowledgement that the connection is there. 3. us leadership remains reflexively multicultural.  this is ok to a point, as long as it doesn't shy away from logical, objective analysis of when a society could be seriously improved in certain ways. we all have disagreements, but at some point it becomes a crime against humanity.    i didn't say burning the train was a good thing. i said i understood it wasn't a spontaneous attack on people who had done no wrong.  true, although i don't think you were as clear originally. ) sdw",[],4201,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""invented"" being the right word. dubya went to yale and hbs. i guess ""practically"" gets you around that problem.  the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal"" degrees, until they actually own something and hire people, or learn to make something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone is smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow.  btw, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame me for the fact that i'm using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. you were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. i went to missouri, and i don't have a degree in anything actually useful, much less a ""terminal"" one, which means i'm broker than anyone on this list  it's just that you, of all people, lots with educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. the facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and look. there are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and economics is not a zerosum game. the cost of anything, including ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case, intelligence and effort.  i will, however, admit to being educated waay past my level of competence, and, by the way you discuss economics, so have you, apparently.    its interesting but in this part of the world (nova scotia) a recent study found that college graduates earn less than graduates of 2 year community colleges (trade schools). they did decline to mention that the demand for some trades is so great that some of them are demanding university degrees to get in. just for the record  the average salary for a university graduate (including advanced degree holders) here is c$ 21,000   $14,000 us. no wonder half of san francisco has set up here  we have a whole whack of call centers that have arrived here in the last couple of years  i think they hire some entry level it people for around $10 ($6 us) an hour, which of course, fits perfectly for me  my entry level job, in 1986, paid $11.00 an hour. the fundamental difference is that most of the jobs that require a trade are unionized.in other words, in this part of the world, for the vast majority of people, union dues are a better investment than tuition. the counterargument to this is that many college graduates leave for better work elsewhere, but the countercounter argument is that we are the thin edge (one of several really  prison labor in the us would be another) of thirdworld wages and work practices coming to north america. i worked at a company that had a 14year wage freeze. the fact that they could maintain that (and prosper) just says volumes about the economy in this part of the world. i met many people there, like me, who felt that was fine, i can vote with my feet. they didn't quite realize that just about every large employer in the area has similar, or worse, policies. anyway eventually they started a union drive. during the vote, retired employees were brought in by the employer (rumours were that they were paid the going rate for a vote around here  a bottle of rum) and somehow allowed to vote . the union filed a grievance  which was denied  by a minister of labour, who, hey, guess what  used to be a vp at the company. that's free labor markets at work. the business continues to prosper  as i was told when i was there  it is a cash cow as long as the joa (joint operating agreement) with the competing paper is in place. and if you think that any of those wonderful american companies, out of some freeenterprise belief in competing for the best talent, are going to do anything about that, sorry, most of them received generous subsidies, in return, i'm sure, for an understanding about the labor markets here.  btw, if we ever actually had free markets in this country, including the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes, all those smart people in the forbes 400 would have more money, and there would be more selfmade people on that list. in addition, most of the people who inherited money on the list would have much less of it, not even relatively speaking. finally, practically all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not.  that efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in the people's republics of berkeley or cambridge. it means more and better stuff, cheaper, over time  a terrible, petitbourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd know about it by now. in economic terms, it's also called an increase in general welfare, and, no, virginia, i'm not talking about extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as santa claus come election time...   much as i like to accept what you say  i do believe in free markets , i have difficulty finding any  except of course for labor markets, which governments go to great lengths to protect (well unless the supply is tight) it was a great run with the technology industry  producing most of the selfmade billionaires on the list, but now we've got a governmentsponsored monopoly, and the concept of ""more stuff, cheaper"" which it has always promised  seems to be disappearing. a particularly galling example is highspeed internet access. an article i read a couple of years ago that it is an area where the pricing approaches of the it industry (cheaper, better or you die) and the telecom industry (maintain your monopoly through regulation, and get guaranteed price increases through the same regulators) meet. sadly to say, the telecom industry seems to have won. the whole entertainment industryriaapalladium thing seems to be another instance where actually giving value to the customer seems less important than using regulation to reduce competition and substitute products in order to produce profits for the favored few.  in short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just that horseshit, happy or otherwise.  to believe otherwise, is  quite literally, given the time marx wrote capital and the manifesto  romantic nonsense.   i usually agree  but when there's a republican in office  i feel like they're the biggest believers in the manifesto, in reverse. create a reserve pool of labor, reduce the rights of that ""proletariat"" you've just created with bogus ""law and order"" policies , concentrate capital in the hands of a few (ideally people who can get you reelected) and the economy will take care of itself. oh, and lie  use the word ""compassionate"" a lot. i guess i tend to believe that a certain amount of poverty reduction actually helps a modern capitalist state  the basic economic tenet of the republic party seems to be the more homeless under each overpass, the more efficient the rest of us will be. and the facts are, for most people in the western world are declining standards of living, declining benefits, disappearing social safety net, greater working hours, essentially since the entrance of women into the work force (not blaming women in any way,

(in fact, it is almost inconceivable he would make that claim. it sounds like a modern keynsian was creating an urban legend.) otoh the lack of sufficient circulating monetary instruments was economically crippling. imagine trying to buy your supplies by offering ious on your own name  and then trying to market  exchange the paper as the merchant who took the iou.  the most common problem in the world is when a government prints too much money. the effects are a complete disaster. there are a lot of incentives that push governments into doing this even though it is incredibly stupid. so almost all the literature talks about that. but you can also screw an economy over by taking all the money out of circulation. the fundamental cause of the american great depression was exactly this, courtesy of the federal reserve board. i don't think shifting the power to print money to the bank of canada had much effect. and canada is still a prosperous country.  original message  from on behalf of gary  lawrence murphy  sent saturday, september 21, 2002 731 am  to mr. fork  cc  subject re sed sunited statesroman empireg    ""f""  fork list mr. writes   f ""free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift  f whole societies out of poverty"" i'm not a  f sociopoliticalhistory buff  does anybody have some clear  f examples?   china? ooops, no wait, scratch that.   there is one counter example that i can think of, but it may not be  precisely ""free trademarkets""  when ben franklin first visited  england he was asked why the colonies were so prosperous. ben  explained that they used ""colonial script"", a kind of barterdollar,  and increasing the supply of script ensured complete employment. the  british bankers were furious and immediately lobbied parliament to  clamp down on the practice. within a few years, the colonies were  rife with unemployment and poverty just like the rest of the empire.   according to questionable literature handed out by a fringe political  party here in canada, the founding fathers had no real complaint about  tea taxes, it was the banning of colonial script they were  protesting. if this is true, then it comes right back to the forces  that killed ned ludd's followers as to why popular opinion believes  they were protesting a tea tax. the same pamphlet claimed that canada  was also a prosperous nation until, by an act of parliament in the  late50's or early 60's, the right to print money was removed from the  juristiction of parliament and handed over to the bank of canada.   i've wondered about all this. certainly the timeline of the collapse  of the canadian economy fits the profile, but there are oodles of  other causes (for example, spending money like we had 300m people when  we only had 20m) anyone have any further information on this?     gary lawrence murphy   teledynamics communications   blog  biz   ""computers are useless. they can only give you answers.""

""it looked like a bison skull,"" the building contractor and amateur archaeologist recalls. ""i thought, 'that's strange. bison don't live this high up.' "" knapp brought the skull to the denver museum of nature and science, where scientists last month announced that it was indeed from a bisonone that died about 340 years ago. ""this was an extraordinary discovery,"" says russ graham, the museum's chief curator, adding that it could alter notions of the mountain environment centuries ago. ""there's probably a lot more like it yet to be found."" and not just bison. colorado isn't the only place where glaciers and snowfields are melting. decades of unusual warmth in regions from peru to alaskaa trend some think is linked to emissions from cars and industryhave shrunk or thawed many of the world's 70,000 glaciers. as the ice recedes, a treasuretrove of human and animal artifacts is emerging, extraordinarily well preserved after centuries in the deep freeze. the fabrics, wood, bone, and dnarich tissue found on the mucky fringes of the ice are revising scientists' understanding of our predecessors' health, habits, and technology, and the prey they pursued. ""it's mindboggling how many different fields are being advanced through studying these remains,"" says johan reinhard, a highaltitude archaeologist and explorerinresidence at the national geographic society. rare, spectacular finds like the frozen mummies he discovered in the andes of peru in the 1990s and the legendary 5,300yearold ""ice man,"" found at the edge of a receding glacier in the alps in 1991, have offered time capsules of cultural and biological information. now, as the ice continues to retreat, it is yielding not just occasional treasures but long records of humans and animals in the high mountains. vanishing act. the trick is finding such specimens before mother natureand looterstake them first. once uncovered, frozen remains can deteriorate within hours or be gnawed by animals. moreover, they're often so well preserved when they emerge that people who come upon them don't even realize they're ancient. that was the case when three men hunting sheep near a high glacier in british columbia, canada, three years ago saw what they thought was a dead animal. ""it looked a little like sealskin buried in the ice,"" recalls warren ward, a teacher from nearby nelson. ""but when i looked closer i could see leather fringe from a coat and finger bones."" figuring they had found the remains of another hunter, or perhaps a fur trapper, the men stowed a flint knife and other artifacts in a ziploc bag and delivered them to local officials. archaeologists later exhumed the fallen hunter's body, along with a woven hat, fur clothing, and what seemed to be a medicine bag. carbon dating revealed that the hunter lived about 550 years ago. dubbed kwaday dan ts'inchi, or long ago person found, by people of the champagne and aishihik first nations (who may be his direct descendants), he is perhaps the bestpreserved human from the period ever found in north america. other findings from melting ice in the neighboring yukon region could explain what that longago person was doing in the mountains in the first place. ""before this there was no archaeological record of people living here,"" says greg hare, a yukon government archaeologist. ""now we see that this area was very much part of people's seasonal activities."" like ward's discovery, the search began by chance, when kristin benedek caught a whiff of what smelled like a barnyard as she and her husband, gerry kuzyk, hunted sheep at 6,000 feet in the mountains of the south yukon. they followed the scent to a melting patch of ice covered in caribou dung. ""it was really odd, because i knew there hadn't been caribou in the area for at least 100 years,"" recalls kuzyk, then a wildlife biologist with the yukon government. caribou cake. returning a week later, he found ""what looked like a pencil with string wrapped around it."" it turned out to be a 4,300yearold atlatl, or spear thrower. further investigation of the ice patchand scores of others around the regionrevealed icy layer cakes filled with caribou remains and human detritus chronicling 7,800 years of changing hunting practices. scientists now believe ancient caribou and other animals flocked to the ice each summer to cool down and escape swarming mosquitoes and flies. hunters followed the game. they returned for centuries and discarded some equipment in the ice. ""we've got people hunting with throwing darts up until 1,200 years ago,"" says hare, who now oversees the research project. ""then we see the first appearance of the bow and arrow about 1,300 years ago. and by 1,200 years ago, there's no more throwing darts."" now scientists are trying to make the search less a matter of luck. they are developing sophisticated computer models that combine data on where glaciers are melting fastest and where humans and animals are known to have migrated to pinpoint the best places to search in alaska's wrangell and st. elias mountain rangesthe united states' most glaciated terrainand in the andes. johan reinhard thinks the fast thawing european alps could also deliver more findings, perhaps as exquisite as the ice man.

""this is a huge opportunity for pirus in a storage market dominated by 6,7 or 8 systemlevel players,"" lovington said. ""sun sees this acquisition as a critical element to their n1 initiative. the synergies were quite obvious."" n1 is sun's hopeful tour de force in distributed computing (define) architecture, which involves multiple, remote computers that each have a role in a computation problem or information processing. n1 is being styled as the answer for companies looking to manage groups of computers and networks as a single system  at a lower cost and with greater flexibility. while lagging behind other, more entrenched players, sun is gaining ground in the storage market with its sun storedge complete storage solutions, according to a new report by idc. john mcarthur, group vice president of idc's storage program, said sun microsystems and ibm posted the largest increases in total storage revenue over q1 2002, with 32% and 11% gains, respectively. as of q2, sun held a 9 percent market share, with revenues of $411 million. sun's acquisition of pirus is expected to close in the second quarter of sun's 2003 fiscal year, which ends december 29, 2002.",[],2439,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(we simply listen for the wmcontextmenu message. that message fires when win32 wants to fire it.)  validation  err, no. not a usability problem. to the average bear, this is completely irrelevant.  preferences  imo this should be much higher on the list. preferences are a tangled pathetic mess. again, separating prefs for individual apps into unique dialogs would simplify things a great deal, but we should also remove nearly half the preferences that exist from the gui. mozilla is ridiculously overconfigurable. 1 2",[],2947,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""files can be cached on multiple systems randomly scattered around the internet, as with napster or freenet. in fact, the caching in xdegrees is more sophisticated than it is on those systems users with high bandwidth connections can download portions, or ""stripes,"" of a file from several cached locations simultaneously. the xdegrees software then reassembles these stripes into the whole file and uses digital signatures to verify that the downloaded file is the same as the original. a key component of this digital signature is a digest of the file, which is stored as an http header for the file.""",[],2120,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(ntfs lives with the latter strategy just fine from my experiments. i have not tried it on extf3 or reiser.) btw, think about your mention of raid and consider the complexity of writing to raid4 or raid5... i would contend that with cheaper storage these days, it makes little sense to use raid, save for shadowing and possibly striping. those at least do not have the complexity and slowup dangers that higher raid levels have, and there is not a need to save the cost of disk so much where a single disk may hold 200 gigs and up. why not dedicate another whole disk to fault recovery and lose the complexity and slow write (sometimes) of raid? glenn everhart original message from sent tuesday, september 03, 2002 304 pm to webappsec securityfocus.com secprog securityfocus subject use of base image  delta image for automated recovery from attacks hi, i was inspired by a mode of operation supported by vmware. you can have a base disk image shared by multiple virtual machine (vm) instances. that base image is never altered by a vm instance. instead, each vm instance writes changes to its own ""redo"" log. future hard disk reads from that vm instance incorporate both the base image and the appropriate redo log to present the current disk image for that specific virtual machine. this is described here (thanks to duane for providing this link on the honeypots mailing list) could this basic concept be used to easily make selffixing clientserver applications that efficiently and automatically recover from most attacks, even before those attacks have been discovered? here is what i imagine. the physical architectures of most production clientserver systems are layered. for example, your basic web application might have a web server running apache, connected to an application server running some j2ee or .net business logic, connected to a database server for persistence. the only one of these whose disk image really should evolve over time is the database server, and even here you often put the static rdbms software on one partition and the changeable datafiles on another partition. it is only the partition with the volatile datafiles that must be allowed to change from one boot to the next. other paritions may need to be writable for, say, swap space, but these changes could be eliminated on each reboot. when someone cracks this system, they will probably change an image that shouldn't be changed. e.g., they might leverage a buffer overflow in iis or apache to install a trojan or a backdoor on the more exposed web server. but what if the web server ran off a base image, writing changes to a ""delta"" or ""redo"" partition? and then what if every night it automatically erased the redo partition and rebooted? the downtime involved for each machine would be minimal, because it is only deleting data  rather than restoring from backup. in a system with redundant web servers for load balancing or high availability, this could be scheduled in a way such that the system is always accessible. this baseredo partition concept could be implemented at the same level as a feature of hardware raid, allowing for greater performance, reliability, and hack resistance. this concept could also be applied to the application servers, and even the database server partitions (except for those partitions which contain the table data files, of course.) does anyone do this already? or is this a new concept? or has this concept been discussed before and abandoned for some reasons that i don't yet know? i use the physical architecture of a basic web application as an example in this post, but this concept could of course be applied to most server systems. it would allow for the hardwareseparation of volatile and nonvolatile disk images. it would be analogous to performing nightly ghosting operations, only it would be more efficient and involve less (or no) downtime. thanks for any opinions, ben  this transmission may contain information that is privileged, confidential andor exempt from disclosure under applicable law. if you are not the intended recipient, you are hereby notified that any disclosure, copying, distribution, or use of the information contained herein (including any reliance thereon) is strictly prohibited. if you received this transmission in error, please immediately contact the sender and destroy the material in its entirety, whether in electronic or hard copy format. thank you",[],5890,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""this company was founded on the notion of security value,"" levchin says. ""peter thiel and i shared that vision from the very beginning."" thiel concentrates on company business matters, whereas levchin remains focused on security, which he says is the key to the company's good fortune.

""we spend a lot of time designing security so it doesn't step on the toes of convenience and not the other way around. the tradeoff is fundamental."" mountain view, calif.based paypal allows businesses and consumers with email addresses to send and receive payments via the internet, accepting credit card or bank account payments for purchases. the service extends to 38 countries, with more than 17 million users and more than 3 million business accounts. most of paypal's users are participants in online auctions, which led paypal to be closely linked with ebay, the leading web auction site. although they were once rivals, the relationship between the two companies resulted july 8 in ebay's tentative $1.5 billion acquisition of paypal. the agreement is subject to regulatory review. levchin says he will stay at paypal as it merges with ebay. ""there are areas of synergy and collaboration we can explore."" although security is a dominant feature for paypal, the company's ability to carry out open communications among the millions of participants fits the growing web services model, levchin says. ""this is a service that links people and allows them to send messages to one another,"" he says. levchin is a panelist at infoworld's nextgeneration web services ii conference sept. 20 paypal, as an online payment system, is a natural target for fraud. and levchin has almost singlehandedly saved the company from thieves bent on exploiting the system, says avivah litan, a vice president and analyst covering financial services at stamford, conn.based gartner. ""if they didn't have max, they might have succumbed, because paypal was susceptible to fraud and money laundering, and max tightened them up,"" litan says. to combat criminals, levchin established ""igor,"" an antifraud program that monitors transactions and warns of suspicious accounts. levchin says building security and antifraud systems is a job he relishes.

the human  race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. absolutely correct. perhaps the most fundamental thing to realize about life on earth today. the following is a fascinating document of official government policy that bears close reading. it is the aspirations of a wonderful nation in an imperfect world.  the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations. it does,  however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, a battle for the  future of the muslim world. this is a struggle of ideas and this is an  area where america must excel. i was recently at a lecture about the surprising success of radio sawa, our new musicandnews channel for 1530 year old arabs. it's 1 in practically every market it's entered, nearing 90% listenership in amman. and it's even beginning to be trusted for news, well past bbc and taking share from every other government broadcaster. it is as hard to imagine america losing a war of ideas in the longterm as it is to imagine america making any headway at all in the short term. many of you may disagree, but i found the document below surprisingly centrist. if you know the code, you can hear clearly partisan tones, re icc, taiwan relations act, etc. but, still, this is as much a democratic platform as not. africa and aids take up more mindshare than i feared they might. as you read, replace ""united states"" with ""roman empire"" and it may make as much sense, in the long view of history. i don't know how proud to be about that, but it is telling. sometime i daydream that the president might sit down with the

courses, warehouses, libraries, clinics and all the rest of the influence a trillion dollars here or there can buy. of course, this still doesn't leave me any more comfortable with the real news in this document the bush doctrine for preemptive strikes. i'd sooner repeal the church amendments on covert action than permit such a principle to be loosed upon the world. rohit  september 20, 2002 full text bush's national security strategy following is the full text of president bush's new national security strategy. the document, entitled ""the national security strategy of the united states,"" will soon be transmitted to congress as a declaration of the administration's policy. introduction the great struggles of the twentieth century between liberty and totalitarianism ended with a decisive victory for the forces of freedom  and a single sustainable model for national success freedom, democracy, and free enterprise. in the twentyfirst century, only nations that share a commitment to protecting basic human rights and guaranteeing political and economic freedom will be able to unleash the potential of their people and assure their future prosperity. people everywhere want to say what they think choose who will govern them worship as they please educate their children  male and female own property and enjoy the benefits of their labor. these values of freedom are right and true for every person, in every society  and the duty of protecting these values against their enemies is the common calling of freedomloving people across the globe and across the ages. today, the united states enjoys a position of unparalleled military strength and great economic and political influence. in keeping with our heritage and principles, we do not use our strength to press for unilateral advantage. we seek instead to create a balance of power that favors human freedom conditions in which all nations and all societies can choose for themselves the rewards and challenges of political and economic liberty. by making the world safer, we allow the people of the world to make their own lives better. we will defend this just peace against threats from terrorists and tyrants. we will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers. we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent. defending our nation against its enemies is the first and fundamental commitment of the federal government. today, that task has changed dramatically. enemies in the past needed great armies and great industrial capabilities to endanger america. now, shadowy networks of individuals can bring great chaos and suffering to our shores for less than it costs to purchase a single tank. terrorists are organized to penetrate open societies and to turn the power of modern technologies against us. to defeat this threat we must make use of every tool in our arsenal  from better homeland defenses and law enforcement to intelligence and cutting off terrorist financing. the war against terrorists of global reach is a global enterprise of uncertain duration. america will help nations that need our assistance in combating terror. and america will hold to account nations that are compromised by terror  because the allies of terror are the enemies of civilization. the united states and countries cooperating with us must not allow the terrorists to develop new home bases. together, we will seek to deny them sanctuary at every turn. the gravest danger our nation faces lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology. our enemies have openly declared that they are seeking weapons of mass destruction, and evidence indicates that they are doing so with determination. the united states will not allow these efforts to succeed. we will build defenses against ballistic missiles and other means of delivery. we will cooperate with other nations to deny, contain, and curtail our enemies' efforts to acquire dangerous technologies. and, as a matter of common sense and selfdefense, america will act against such emerging threats before they are fully formed. we cannot defend america and our friends by hoping for the best. so we must be prepared to defeat our enemies' plans, using the best intelligence and proceeding with deliberation. history will judge harshly those who saw this coming danger but failed to act. in the new world we have entered, the only path to safety is the path of action. as we defend the peace, we will also take advantage of an historic opportunity to preserve the peace. today, the international community has the best chance since the rise of the nationstate in the seventeenth century to build a world where great powers compete in peace instead of continually prepare for war. today, the world's great powers find ourselves on the same side  united by common dangers of terrorist violence and chaos. the united states will build on these common interests to promote global security. we are also increasingly united by common values. russia is in the midst of a hopeful transition, reaching for its democratic future and a partner in the war on terror. chinese leaders are discovering that economic freedom is the only source of national wealth. in time, they will find that social and political freedom is the only source of national greatness. america will encourage the advancement of democracy and economic openness in both nations, because these are the best foundations for domestic stability and international order. we will strongly resist aggression from other great powers  even as we welcome their peaceful pursuit of prosperity, trade, and cultural advancement. finally, the united states will use this moment of opportunity to extend the benefits of freedom across the globe. we will actively work to bring the hope of democracy, development, free markets, and free trade to every corner of the world. the events of september 11, 2001, taught us that weak states, like afghanistan, can pose as great a danger to our national interests as strong states. poverty does not make poor people into terrorists and murderers. yet poverty, weak institutions, and corruption can make weak states vulnerable to terrorist networks and drug cartels within their borders. the united states will stand beside any nation determined to build a better future by seeking the rewards of liberty for its people. free trade and free markets have proven their ability to lift whole societies out of poverty  so the united states will work with individual nations, entire regions, and the entire global trading community to build a world that trades in freedom and therefore grows in prosperity. the united states will deliver greater development assistance through the new millennium challenge account to nations that govern justly, invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. we will also continue to lead the world in efforts to reduce the terrible toll of aids and other infectious diseases. in building a balance of power that favors freedom, the united states is guided by the conviction that all nations have important responsibilities. nations that enjoy freedom must actively fight terror. nations that depend on international stability must help prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction. nations that seek international aid must govern themselves wisely, so that aid is well spent. for freedom to thrive, accountability must be expected and required. we are also guided by the conviction that no nation can build a safer, better world alone. alliances and multilateral institutions can multiply the strength of freedomloving nations. the united states is committed to lasting institutions like the united nations, the world trade organization, the organization of american states, and nato as well as other longstanding alliances. coalitions of the willing can augment these permanent institutions. in all cases, international obligations are to be taken seriously. they are not to be undertaken symbolically to rally support for an ideal without furthering its attainment. freedom is the nonnegotiable demand of human dignity the birthright of every person  in every civilization. throughout history, freedom has been threatened by war and terror it has been challenged by the clashing wills of powerful states and the evil designs of tyrants and it has been tested by widespread poverty and disease. today, humanity holds in its hands the opportunity to further freedom's triumph over all these foes. the united states welcomes our responsibility to lead in this great mission. i. overview of america's international strategy ""our nation's cause has always been larger than our nation's defense. we fight, as we always fight, for a just peace  a peace that favors liberty. we will defend the peace against the threats from terrorists and tyrants. we will preserve the peace by building good relations among the great powers. and we will extend the peace by encouraging free and open societies on every continent."" president bush west point, new york june 1, 2002 the united states possesses unprecedented  and unequaled  strength and influence in the world. sustained by faith in the principles of liberty, and the value of a free society, this position comes with unparalleled responsibilities, obligations, and opportunity. the great strength of this nation must be used to promote a balance of power that favors freedom. for most of the twentieth century, the world was divided by a great struggle over ideas destructive totalitarian visions versus freedom and equality. that great struggle is over. the militant visions of class, nation, and race which promised utopia and delivered misery have been defeated and discredited. america is now threatened less by conquering states than we are by failing ones. we are menaced less by fleets and armies than by catastrophic technologies in the hands of the embittered few. we must defeat these threats to our nation, allies, and friends. this is also a time of opportunity for america. we will work to translate this moment of influence into decades of peace, prosperity, and liberty. the u.s. national security strategy will be based on a distinctly american internationalism that reflects the union of our values and our national interests. the aim of this strategy is to help make the world not just safer but better. our goals on the path to progress are clear political and economic freedom, peaceful relations with other states, and respect for human dignity. and this path is not america's alone. it is open to all. to achieve these goals, the united states will  champion aspirations for human dignity  strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends  work with others to defuse regional conflicts  prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our friends, with weapons of mass destruction  ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade  expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy  develop agendas for cooperative action with other main centers of global power and  transform america's national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twentyfirst century. ii. champion aspirations for human dignity ""some worry that it is somehow undiplomatic or impolite to speak the language of right and wrong. i disagree. different circumstances require different methods, but not different moralities."" president bush west point, new york june 1, 2002 in pursuit of our goals, our first imperative is to clarify what we stand for the united states must defend liberty and justice because these principles are right and true for all people everywhere. no nation owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. fathers and mothers in all societies want their children to be educated and to live free from poverty and violence. no people on earth yearn to be oppressed, aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police. america must stand firmly for the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity the rule of law limits on the absolute power of the state free speech freedom of worship equal justice respect for women religious and ethnic tolerance and respect for private property. these demands can be met in many ways. america's constitution has served us well. many other nations, with different histories and cultures, facing different circumstances, have successfully incorporated these core principles into their own systems of governance. history has not been kind to those nations which ignored or flouted the rights and aspirations of their people. our own history is a long struggle to live up to our ideals. but even in our worst moments, the principles enshrined in the declaration of independence were there to guide us. as a result, america is not just a stronger, but is a freer and more just society. today, these ideals are a lifeline to lonely defenders of liberty. and when openings arrive, we can encourage change  as we did in central and eastern europe between 1989 and 1991, or in belgrade in 2000. when we see democratic processes take hold among our friends in taiwan or in the republic of korea, and see elected leaders replace generals in latin america and africa, we see examples of how authoritarian systems can evolve, marrying local history and traditions with the principles we all cherish. embodying lessons from our past and using the opportunity we have today, the national security strategy of the united states must start from these core beliefs and look outward for possibilities to expand liberty. our principles will guide our government's decisions about international cooperation, the character of our foreign assistance, and the allocation of resources. they will guide our actions and our words in international bodies. we will  speak out honestly about violations of the nonnegotiable demands of human dignity using our voice and vote in international institutions to advance freedom  use our foreign aid to promote freedom and support those who struggle nonviolently for it, ensuring that nations moving toward democracy are rewarded for the steps they take  make freedom and the development of democratic institutions key themes in our bilateral relations, seeking solidarity and cooperation from other democracies while we press governments that deny human rights to move toward a better future and  take special efforts to promote freedom of religion and conscience and defend it from encroachment by repressive governments. we will champion the cause of human dignity and oppose those who resist it. iii. strengthen alliances to defeat global terrorism and work to prevent attacks against us and our friends ""just three days removed from these events, americans do not yet have the distance of history. but our responsibility to history is already clear to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil. war has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. this nation is peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. the conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others. it will end in a way, and at an hour, of our choosing."" president bush washington, d.c. (the national cathedral) september 14, 2001 the united states of america is fighting a war against terrorists of global reach. the enemy is not a single political regime or person or religion or ideology. the enemy is terrorism  premeditated, politically motivated violence perpetrated against innocents. in many regions, legitimate grievances prevent the emergence of a lasting peace. such grievances deserve to be, and must be, addressed within a political process. but no cause justifies terror. the united states will make no concessions to terrorist demands and strike no deals with them. we make no distinction between terrorists and those who knowingly harbor or provide aid to them. the struggle against global terrorism is different from any other war in our history. it will be fought on many fronts against a particularly elusive enemy over an extended period of time. progress will come through the persistent accumulation of successes  some seen, some unseen. today our enemies have seen the results of what civilized nations can, and will, do against regimes that harbor, support, and use terrorism to achieve their political goals. afghanistan has been liberated coalition forces continue to hunt down the taliban and alqaida. but it is not only this battlefield on which we will engage terrorists. thousands of trained terrorists remain at large with cells in north america, south america, europe, africa, the middle east, and across asia. our priority will be first to disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations of global reach and attack their leadership command, control, and communications material support and finances. this will have a disabling effect upon the terrorists' ability to plan and operate. we will continue to encourage our regional partners to take up a coordinated effort that isolates the terrorists. once the regional campaign localizes the threat to a particular state, we will help ensure the state has the military, law enforcement, political, and financial tools necessary to finish the task. the united states will continue to work with our allies to disrupt the financing of terrorism. we will identify and block the sources of funding for terrorism, freeze the assets of terrorists and those who support them, deny terrorists access to the international financial system, protect legitimate charities from being abused by terrorists, and prevent the movement of terrorists' assets through alternative financial networks. however, this campaign need not be sequential to be effective, the cumulative effect across all regions will help achieve the results we seek. we will disrupt and destroy terrorist organizations by  direct and continuous action using all the elements of national and international power. our immediate focus will be those terrorist organizations of global reach and any terrorist or state sponsor of terrorism which attempts to gain or use weapons of mass destruction (wmd) or their precursors  defending the united states, the american people, and our interests at home and abroad by identifying and destroying the threat before it reaches our borders. while the united states will constantly strive to enlist the support of the international community, we will not hesitate to act alone, if necessary, to exercise our right of selfdefense by acting preemptively against such terrorists, to prevent them from doing harm against our people and our country and  denying further sponsorship, support, and sanctuary to terrorists by convincing or compelling states to accept their sovereign responsibilities. we will also wage a war of ideas to win the battle against international terrorism. this includes  using the full influence of the united states, and working closely with allies and friends, to make clear that all acts of terrorism are illegitimate so that terrorism will be viewed in the same light as slavery, piracy, or genocide behavior that no respectable government can condone or support and all must oppose  supporting moderate and modern government, especially in the muslim world, to ensure that the conditions and ideologies that promote terrorism do not find fertile ground in any nation  diminishing the underlying conditions that spawn terrorism by enlisting the international community to focus its efforts and resources on areas most at risk and  using effective public diplomacy to promote the free flow of information and ideas to kindle the hopes and aspirations of freedom of those in societies ruled by the sponsors of global terrorism. while we recognize that our best defense is a good offense we are also strengthening america's homeland security to protect against and deter attack. this administration has proposed the largest government reorganization since the truman administration created the national security council and the department of defense. centered on a new department of homeland security and including a new unified military command and a fundamental reordering of the fbi, our comprehensive plan to secure the homeland encompasses every level of government and the cooperation of the public and the private sector. this strategy will turn adversity into opportunity. for example, emergency management systems will be better able to cope not just with terrorism but with all hazards. our medical system will be strengthened to manage not just bioterror, but all infectious diseases and masscasualty dangers. our border controls will not just stop terrorists, but improve the efficient movement of legitimate traffic. while our focus is protecting america, we know that to defeat terrorism in today's globalized world we need support from our allies and friends. wherever possible, the united states will rely on regional organizations and state powers to meet their obligations to fight terrorism. where governments find the fight against terrorism beyond their capacities, we will match their willpower and their resources with whatever help we and our allies can provide. as we pursue the terrorists in afghanistan, we will continue to work with international organizations such as the united nations, as well as nongovernmental organizations, and other countries to provide the humanitarian, political, economic, and security assistance necessary to rebuild afghanistan so that it will never again abuse its people, threaten its neighbors, and provide a haven for terrorists in the war against global terrorism, we will never forget that we are ultimately fighting for our democratic values and way of life. freedom and fear are at war, and there will be no quick or easy end to this conflict. in leading the campaign against terrorism, we are forging new, productive international relationships and redefining existing ones in ways that meet the challenges of the twentyfirst century. iv. work with others to defuse regional conflicts ""we build a world of justice, or we will live in a world of coercion. the magnitude of our shared responsibilities makes our disagreements look so small."" president bush berlin, germany may 23, 2002 concerned nations must remain actively engaged in critical regional disputes to avoid explosive escalation and minimize human suffering. in an increasingly interconnected world, regional crisis can strain our alliances, rekindle rivalries among the major powers, and create horrifying affronts to human dignity. when violence erupts and states falter, the united states will work with friends and partners to alleviate suffering and restore stability. no doctrine can anticipate every circumstance in which u.s. action  direct or indirect  is warranted. we have finite political, economic, and military resources to meet our global priorities. the united states will approach each case with these strategic principles in mind  the united states should invest time and resources into building international relationships and institutions that can help manage local crises when they emerge.  the united states should be realistic about its ability to help those who are unwilling or unready to help themselves. where and when people are ready to do their part, we will be willing to move decisively. policies in several key regions offer some illustrations of how we will apply these principles the israelipalestinian conflict is critical because of the toll of human suffering, because of america's close relationship with the state of israel and key arab states, and because of that region's importance to other global priorities of the united states. there can be no peace for either side without freedom for both sides. america stands committed to an independent and democratic palestine, living beside israel in peace and security. like all other people, palestinians deserve a government that serves their interests, and listens to their voices, and counts their votes. the united states will continue to encourage all parties to step up to their responsibilities as we seek a just and comprehensive settlement to the conflict. the united states, the international donor community, and the world bank stand ready to work with a reformed palestinian government on economic development, increased humanitarian assistance and a program to establish, finance, and monitor a truly independent judiciary. if palestinians embrace democracy, and the rule of law, confront corruption, and firmly reject terror, they can count on american support for the creation of a palestinian state. israel also has a large stake in the success of a democratic palestine. permanent occupation threatens israel's identity and democracy. so the united states continues to challenge israeli leaders to take concrete steps to support the emergence of a viable, credible palestinian state. as there is progress towards security, israel forces need to withdraw fully to positions they held prior to september 28, 2000. and consistent with the recommendations of the mitchell committee, israeli settlement activity in the occupied territories must stop. as violence subsides, freedom of movement should be restored, permitting innocent palestinians to resume work and normal life. the united states can play a crucial role but, ultimately, lasting peace can only come when israelis and palestinians resolve the issues and end the conflict between them. in south asia, the united states has also emphasized the need for india and pakistan to resolve their disputes. this administration invested time and resources building strong bilateral relations with india and pakistan. these strong relations then gave us leverage to play a constructive role when tensions in the region became acute. with pakistan, our bilateral relations have been bolstered by pakistan's choice to join the war against terror and move toward building a more open and tolerant society. the administration sees india's potential to become one of the great democratic powers of the twentyfirst century and has worked hard to transform our relationship accordingly. our involvement in this regional dispute, building on earlier investments in bilateral relations, looks first to concrete steps by india and pakistan that can help defuse military confrontation. indonesia took courageous steps to create a working democracy and respect for the rule of law. by tolerating ethnic minorities, respecting the rule of law, and accepting open markets, indonesia may be able to employ the engine of opportunity that has helped lift some of its neighbors out of poverty and desperation. it is the initiative by indonesia that allows u.s. assistance to make a difference. in the western hemisphere we have formed flexible coalitions with countries that share our priorities, particularly mexico, brazil, canada, chile, and colombia. together we will promote a truly democratic hemisphere where our integration advances security, prosperity, opportunity, and hope. we will work with regional institutions, such as the summit of the americas process, the organization of american states (oas), and the defense ministerial of the americas for the benefit of the entire hemisphere. parts of latin america confront regional conflict, especially arising from the violence of drug cartels and their accomplices. this conflict and unrestrained narcotics trafficking could imperil the health and security of the united states. therefore we have developed an active strategy to help the andean nations adjust their economies, enforce their laws, defeat terrorist organizations, and cut off the supply of drugs, while  as important  we work to reduce the demand for drugs in our own country. in colombia, we recognize the link between terrorist and extremist groups that challenge the security of the state and drug trafficking activities that help finance the operations of such groups. we are working to help colombia defend its democratic institutions and defeat illegal armed groups of both the left and right by extending effective sovereignty over the entire national territory and provide basic security to the colombian people. in africa, promise and opportunity sit side by side with disease, war, and desperate poverty. this threatens both a core value of the united states  preserving human dignity  and our strategic priority  combating global terror. american interests and american principles, therefore, lead in the same direction we will work with others for an african continent that lives in liberty, peace, and growing prosperity. together with our european allies, we must help strengthen africa's fragile states, help build indigenous capability to secure porous borders, and help build up the law enforcement and intelligence infrastructure to deny havens for terrorists. an ever more lethal environment exists in africa as local civil wars spread beyond borders to create regional war zones. forming coalitions of the willing and cooperative security arrangements are key to confronting these emerging transnational threats. africa's great size and diversity requires a security strategy that focuses bilateral engagement, and builds coalitions of the willing. this administration will focus on three interlocking strategies for the region  countries with major impact on their neighborhood such as south africa, nigeria, kenya, and ethiopia are anchors for regional engagement and require focused attention  coordination with european allies and international institutions is essential for constructive conflict mediation and successful peace operations and  africa's capable reforming states and subregional organizations must be strengthened as the primary means to address transnational threats on a sustained basis. ultimately the path of political and economic freedom presents the surest route to progress in subsaharan africa, where most wars are conflicts over material resources and political access often tragically waged on the basis of ethnic and religious difference. the transition to the african union with its stated commitment to good governance and a common responsibility for democratic political systems offers opportunities to strengthen democracy on the continent. v. prevent our enemies from threatening us, our allies, and our friends with weapons of mass destruction ""the gravest danger to freedom lies at the crossroads of radicalism and technology. when the spread of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons, along with ballistic missile technology  when that occurs, even weak states and small groups could attain a catastrophic power to strike great nations. our enemies have declared this very intention, and have been caught seeking these terrible weapons. they want the capability to blackmail us, or to harm us, or to harm our friends  and we will oppose them with all our power."" president bush west point, new york june 1, 2002 the nature of the cold war threat required the united states  with our allies and friends  to emphasize deterrence of the enemy's use of force, producing a grim strategy of mutual assured destruction. with the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war, our security environment has undergone profound transformation. having moved from confrontation to cooperation as the hallmark of our relationship with russia, the dividends are evident an end to the balance of terror that divided us an historic reduction in the nuclear arsenals on both sides and cooperation in areas such as counterterrorism and missile defense that until recently were inconceivable. but new deadly challenges have emerged from rogue states and terrorists. none of these contemporary threats rival the sheer destructive power that was arrayed against us by the soviet union. however, the nature and motivations of these new adversaries, their determination to obtain destructive powers hitherto available only to the world's strongest states, and the greater likelihood that they will use weapons of mass destruction against us, make today's security environment more complex and dangerous. in the 1990s we witnessed the emergence of a small number of rogue states that, while different in important ways, share a number of attributes. these states  brutalize their own people and squander their national resources for the personal gain of the rulers  display no regard for international law, threaten their neighbors, and callously violate international treaties to which they are party  are determined to acquire weapons of mass destruction, along with other advanced military technology, to be used as threats or offensively to achieve the aggressive designs of these regimes  sponsor terrorism around the globe and  reject basic human values and hate the united states and everything for which it stands. at the time of the gulf war, we acquired irrefutable proof that iraq's designs were not limited to the chemical weapons it had used against iran and its own people, but also extended to the acquisition of nuclear weapons and biological agents. in the past decade north korea has become the world's principal purveyor of ballistic missiles, and has tested increasingly capable missiles while developing its own wmd arsenal. other rogue regimes seek nuclear, biological, and chemical weapons as well. these states' pursuit of, and global trade in, such weapons has become a looming threat to all nations. we must be prepared to stop rogue states and their terrorist clients before they are able to threaten or use weapons of mass destruction against the united states and our allies and friends. our response must take full advantage of strengthened alliances, the establishment of new partnerships with former adversaries, innovation in the use of military forces, modern technologies, including the development of an effective missile defense system, and increased emphasis on intelligence collection and analysis. our comprehensive strategy to combat wmd includes  proactive counterproliferation efforts. we must deter and defend against the threat before it is unleashed. we must ensure that key capabilities  detection, active and passive defenses, and counterforce capabilities  are integrated into our defense transformation and our homeland security systems. counterproliferation must also be integrated into the doctrine, training, and equipping of our forces and those of our allies to ensure that we can prevail in any conflict with wmdarmed adversaries.  strengthened nonproliferation efforts to prevent rogue states and terrorists from acquiring the materials, technologies and expertise necessary for weapons of mass destruction. we will enhance diplomacy, arms control, multilateral export controls, and threat reduction assistance that impede states and terrorists seeking wmd, and when necessary, interdict enabling technologies and materials. we will continue to build coalitions to support these efforts, encouraging their increased political and financial support for nonproliferation and threat reduction programs. the recent g8 agreement to commit up to $20 billion to a global partnership against proliferation marks a major step forward.  effective consequence management to respond to the effects of wmd use, whether by terrorists or hostile states. minimizing the effects of wmd use against our people will help deter those who possess such weapons and dissuade those who seek to acquire them by persuading enemies that they cannot attain their desired ends. the united states must also be prepared to respond to the effects of wmd use against our forces abroad, and to help friends and allies if they are attacked. it has taken almost a decade for us to comprehend the true nature of this new threat. given the goals of rogue states and terrorists, the united states can no longer solely rely on a reactive posture as we have in the past. the inability to deter a potential attacker, the immediacy of today's threats, and the magnitude of potential harm that could be caused by our adversaries' choice of weapons, do not permit that option. we cannot let our enemies strike first.  in the cold war, especially following the cuban missile crisis, we faced a generally status quo, riskaverse adversary. deterrence was an effective defense. but deterrence based only upon the threat of retaliation is far less likely to work against leaders of rogue states more willing to take risks, gambling with the lives of their people, and the wealth of their nations.  in the cold war, weapons of mass destruction were considered weapons of last resort whose use risked the destruction of those who used them. today, our enemies see weapons of mass destruction as weapons of choice. for rogue states these weapons are tools of intimidation and military aggression against their neighbors. these weapons may also allow these states to attempt to blackmail the united states and our allies to prevent us from deterring or repelling the aggressive behavior of rogue states. such states also see these weapons as their best means of overcoming the conventional superiority of the united states.  traditional concepts of deterrence will not work against a terrorist enemy whose avowed tactics are wanton destruction and the targeting of innocents whose socalled soldiers seek martyrdom in death and whose most potent protection is statelessness. the overlap between states that sponsor terror and those that pursue wmd compels us to action. for centuries, international law recognized that nations need not suffer an attack before they can lawfully take action to defend themselves against forces that present an imminent danger of attack. legal scholars and international jurists often conditioned the legitimacy of preemption on the existence of an imminent threat  most often a visible mobilization of armies, navies, and air forces preparing to attack. we must adapt the concept of imminent threat to the capabilities and objectives of today's adversaries. rogue states and terrorists do not seek to attack us using conventional means. they know such attacks would fail. instead, they rely on acts of terrorism and, potentially, the use of weapons of mass destruction  weapons that can be easily concealed and delivered covertly and without warning. the targets of these attacks are our military forces and our civilian population, in direct violation of one of the principal norms of the law of warfare. as was demonstrated by the losses on september 11, 2001, mass civilian casualties is the specific objective of terrorists and these losses would be exponentially more severe if terrorists acquired and used weapons of mass destruction. the united states has long maintained the option of preemptive actions to counter a sufficient threat to our national security. the greater the threat, the greater is the risk of inaction  and the more compelling the case for taking anticipatory action to defend ourselves, even if uncertainty remains as to the time and place of the enemy's attack. to forestall or prevent such hostile acts by our adversaries, the united states will, if necessary, act preemptively. the united states will not use force in all cases to preempt emerging threats, nor should nations use preemption as a pretext for aggression. yet in an age where the enemies of civilization openly and actively seek the world's most destructive technologies, the united states cannot remain idle while dangers gather. we will always proceed deliberately, weighing the consequences of our actions. to support preemptive options, we will  build better, more integrated intelligence capabilities to provide timely, accurate information on threats, wherever they may emerge  coordinate closely with allies to form a common assessment of the most dangerous threats and  continue to transform our military forces to ensure our ability to conduct rapid and precise operations to achieve decisive results. the purpose of our actions will always be to eliminate a specific threat to the united states or our allies and friends. the reasons for our actions will be clear, the force measured, and the cause just. vi. ignite a new era of global economic growth through free markets and free trade. ""when nations close their markets and opportunity is hoarded by a privileged few, no amount  no amount  of development aid is ever enough. when nations respect their people, open markets, invest in better health and education, every dollar of aid, every dollar of trade revenue and domestic capital is used more effectively."" president bush monterrey, mexico march 22, 2002 a strong world economy enhances our national security by advancing prosperity and freedom in the rest of the world. economic growth supported by free trade and free markets creates new jobs and higher incomes. it allows people to lift their lives out of poverty, spurs economic and legal reform, and the fight against corruption, and it reinforces the habits of liberty. we will promote economic growth and economic freedom beyond america's shores. all governments are responsible for creating their own economic policies and responding to their own economic challenge. we will use our economic engagement with other countries to underscore the benefits of policies that generate higher productivity and sustained economic growth, including  progrowth legal and regulatory policies to encourage business investment, innovation, and entrepreneurial activity  tax policies  particularly lower marginal tax rates  that improve incentives for work and investment  rule of law and intolerance of corruption so that people are confident that they will be able to enjoy the fruits of their economic endeavors  strong financial systems that allow capital to be put to its most efficient use  sound fiscal policies to support business activity  investments in health and education that improve the wellbeing and skills of the labor force and population as a whole and  free trade that provides new avenues for growth and fosters the diffusion of technologies and ideas that increase productivity and opportunity. the lessons of history are clear market economies, not commandandcontrol economies with the heavy hand of government, are the best way to promote prosperity and reduce poverty. policies that further strengthen market incentives and market institutions are relevant for all economies  industrialized countries, emerging markets, and the developing world. a return to strong economic growth in europe and japan is vital to u.s. national security interests. we want our allies to have strong economies for their own sake, for the sake of the global economy, and for the sake of global security. european efforts to remove structural barriers in their economies are particularly important in this regard, as are japan's efforts to end deflation and address the problems of nonperforming loans in the japanese banking system. we will continue to use our regular consultations with japan and our european partners  including through the group of seven (g7)  to discuss policies they are adopting to promote growth in their economies and support higher global economic growth. improving stability in emerging markets is also key to global economic growth. international flows of investment capital are needed to expand the productive potential of these economies. these flows allow emerging markets and developing countries to make the investments that raise living standards and reduce poverty. our longterm objective should be a world in which all countries have investmentgrade credit ratings that allow them access to international capital markets and to invest in their future. we are committed to policies that will help emerging markets achieve access to larger capital flows at lower cost. to this end, we will continue to pursue reforms aimed at reducing uncertainty in financial markets. we will work actively with other countries, the international monetary fund (imf), and the private sector to implement the g7 action plan negotiated earlier this year for preventing financial crises and more effectively resolving them when they occur. the best way to deal with financial crises is to prevent them from occurring, and we have encouraged the imf to improve its efforts doing so. we will continue to work with the imf to streamline the policy conditions for its lending and to focus its lending strategy on achieving economic growth through sound fiscal and monetary policy, exchange rate policy, and financial sector policy. the concept of ""free trade"" arose as a moral principle even before it became a pillar of economics. if you can make something that others value, you should be able to sell it to them. if others make something that you value, you should be able to buy it. this is real freedom, the freedom for a person  or a nation  to make a living. to promote free trade, the unites states has developed a comprehensive strategy  seize the global initiative. the new global trade negotiations we helped launch at doha in november 2001 will have an ambitious agenda, especially in agriculture, manufacturing, and services, targeted for completion in 2005. the united states has led the way in completing the accession of china and a democratic taiwan to the world trade organization. we will assist russia's preparations to join the wto.  press regional initiatives. the united states and other democracies in the western hemisphere have agreed to create the free trade area of the americas, targeted for completion in 2005. this year the united states will advocate marketaccess negotiations with its partners, targeted on agriculture, industrial goods, services, investment, and government procurement. we will also offer more opportunity to the poorest continent, africa, starting with full use of the preferences allowed in the african growth and opportunity act, and leading to free trade.  move ahead with bilateral free trade agreements. building on the free trade agreement with jordan enacted in 2001, the administration will work this year to complete free trade agreements with chile and singapore. our aim is to achieve free trade agreements with a mix of developed and developing countries in all regions of the world. initially, central america, southern africa, morocco, and australia will be our principal focal points.  renew the executivecongressional partnership. every administration's trade strategy depends on a productive partnership with congress. after a gap of 8 years, the administration reestablished majority support in the congress for trade liberalization by passing trade promotion authority and the other market opening measures for developing countries in the trade act of 2002. this administration will work with congress to enact new bilateral, regional, and global trade agreements that will be concluded under the recently passed trade promotion authority.  promote the connection between trade and development. trade policies can help developing countries strengthen property rights, competition, the rule of law, investment, the spread of knowledge, open societies, the efficient allocation of resources, and regional integration  all leading to growth, opportunity, and confidence in developing countries. the united states is implementing the africa growth and opportunity act to provide marketaccess for nearly all goods produced in the 35 countries of subsaharan africa. we will make more use of this act and its equivalent for the caribbean basin and continue to work with multilateral and regional institutions to help poorer countries take advantage of these opportunities. beyond market access, the most important area where trade intersects with poverty is in public health. we will ensure that the wto intellectual property rules are flexible enough to allow developing nations to gain access to critical medicines for extraordinary dangers like hivaids, tuberculosis, and malaria.  enforce trade agreements and laws against unfair practices. commerce depends on the rule of law international trade depends on enforceable agreements. our top priorities are to resolve ongoing disputes with the european union, canada, and mexico and to make a global effort to address new technology, science, and health regulations that needlessly impede farm exports and improved agriculture. laws against unfair trade practices are often abused, but the international community must be able to address genuine concerns about government subsidies and dumping. international industrial espionage which undermines fair competition must be detected and deterred.  help domestic industries and workers adjust. there is a sound statutory framework for these transitional safeguards which we have used in the agricultural sector and which we are using this year to help the american steel industry. the benefits of free trade depend upon the enforcement of fair trading practices. these safeguards help ensure that the benefits of free trade do not come at the expense of american workers. trade adjustment assistance will help workers adapt to the change and dynamism of open markets.  protect the environment and workers. the united states must foster economic growth in ways that will provide a better life along with widening prosperity. we will incorporate labor and environmental concerns into u.s. trade negotiations, creating a healthy ""network"" between multilateral environmental agreements with the wto, and use the international labor organization, trade preference programs, and trade talks to improve working conditions in conjunction with freer trade.  enhance energy security. we will strengthen our own energy security and the shared prosperity of the global economy by working with our allies, trading partners, and energy producers to expand the sources and types of global energy supplied, especially in the western hemisphere, africa, central asia, and the caspian region. we will also continue to work with our partners to develop cleaner and more energy efficient technologies. economic growth should be accompanied by global efforts to stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations associated with this growth, containing them at a level that prevents dangerous human interference with the global climate. our overall objective is to reduce america's greenhouse gas emissions relative to the size of our economy, cutting such emissions per unit of economic activity by 18 percent over the next 10 years, by the year 2012. our strategies for attaining this goal will be to  remain committed to the basic u.n. framework convention for international cooperation  obtain agreements with key industries to cut emissions of some of the most potent greenhouse gases and give transferable credits to companies that can show real cuts  develop improved standards for measuring and registering emission reductions  promote renewable energy production and clean coal technology, as well as nuclear power  which produces no greenhouse gas emissions, while also improving fuel economy for u.s. cars and trucks  increase spending on research and new conservation technologies, to a total of $4.5 billion  the largest sum being spent on climate change by any country in the world and a $700 million increase over last year's budget and  assist developing countries, especially the major greenhouse gas emitters such as china and india, so that they will have the tools and resources to join this effort and be able to grow along a cleaner and better path. vii. expand the circle of development by opening societies and building the infrastructure of democracy ""in world war ii we fought to make the world safer, then worked to rebuild it. as we wage war today to keep the world safe from terror, we must also work to make the world a better place for all its citizens."" president bush washington, d.c. (interamerican development bank) march 14, 2002 a world where some live in comfort and plenty, while half of the human race lives on less than $2 a day, is neither just nor stable. including all of the world's poor in an expanding circle of development  and opportunity  is a moral imperative and one of the top priorities of u.s. international policy. decades of massive development assistance have failed to spur economic growth in the poorest countries. worse, development aid has often served to prop up failed policies, relieving the pressure for reform and perpetuating misery. results of aid are typically measured in dollars spent by donors, not in the rates of growth and poverty reduction achieved by recipients. these are the indicators of a failed strategy. working with other nations, the united states is confronting this failure. we forged a new consensus at the u.n. conference on financing for development in monterrey that the objectives of assistance  and the strategies to achieve those objectives  must change. this administration's goal is to help unleash the productive potential of individuals in all nations. sustained growth and poverty reduction is impossible without the right national policies. where governments have implemented real policy changes we will provide significant new levels of assistance. the united states and other developed countries should set an ambitious and specific target to double the size of the world's poorest economies within a decade. the united states government will pursue these major strategies to achieve this goal  provide resources to aid countries that have met the challenge of national reform. we propose a 50 percent increase in the core development assistance given by the united states. while continuing our present programs, including humanitarian assistance based on need alone, these billions of new dollars will form a new millennium challenge account for projects in countries whose governments rule justly, invest in their people, and encourage economic freedom. governments must fight corruption, respect basic human rights, embrace the rule of law, invest in health care and education, follow responsible economic policies, and enable entrepreneurship. the millennium challenge account will reward countries that have demonstrated real policy change and challenge those that have not to implement reforms.  improve the effectiveness of the world bank and other development banks in raising living standards. the united states is committed to a comprehensive reform agenda for making the world bank and the other multilateral development banks more effective in improving the lives of the world's poor. we have reversed the downward trend in u.s. contributions and proposed an 18 percent increase in the u.s. contributions to the international development association (ida)  the world bank's fund for the poorest countries  and the african development fund. the key to raising living standards and reducing poverty around the world is increasing productivity growth, especially in the poorest countries. we will continue to press the multilateral development banks to focus on activities that increase economic productivity, such as improvements in education, health, rule of law, and private sector development. every project, every loan, every grant must be judged by how much it will increase productivity growth in developing countries.  insist upon measurable results to ensure that development assistance is actually making a difference in the lives of the world's poor. when it comes to economic development, what really matters is that more children are getting a better education, more people have access to health care and clean water, or more workers can find jobs to make a better future for their families. we have a moral obligation to measure the success of our development assistance by whether it is delivering results. for this reason, we will continue to demand that our own development assistance as well as assistance from the multilateral development banks has measurable goals and concrete benchmarks for achieving those goals. thanks to u.s. leadership, the recent ida replenishment agreement will establish a monitoring and evaluation system that measures recipient countries' progress. for the first time, donors can link a portion of their contributions to ida to the achievement of actual development results, and part of the u.s. contribution is linked in this way. we will strive to make sure that the world bank and other multilateral development banks build on this progress so that a focus on results is an integral part of everything that these institutions do.  increase the amount of development assistance that is provided in the form of grants instead of loans. greater use of resultsbased grants is the best way to help poor countries make productive investments, particularly in the social sectors, without saddling them with everlarger debt burdens. as a result of u.s. leadership, the recent ida agreement provided for significant increases in grant funding for the poorest countries for education, hivaids, health, nutrition, water, sanitation, and other human needs. our goal is to build on that progress by increasing the use of grants at the other multilateral development banks. we will also challenge universities, nonprofits, and the private sector to match government efforts by using grants to support development projects that show results.  open societies to commerce and investment. trade and investment are the real engines of economic growth. even if government aid increases, most money for development must come from trade, domestic capital, and foreign investment. an effective strategy must try to expand these flows as well. free markets and free trade are key priorities of our national security strategy.  secure public health. the scale of the public health crisis in poor countries is enormous. in countries afflicted by epidemics and pandemics like hivaids, malaria, and tuberculosis, growth and development will be threatened until these scourges can be contained. resources from the developed world are necessary but will be effective only with honest governance, which supports prevention programs and provides effective local infrastructure. the united states has strongly backed the new global fund for hivaids organized by u.n. secretary general kofi annan and its focus on combining prevention with a broad strategy for treatment and care. the united states already contributes more than twice as much money to such efforts as the next largest donor. if the global fund demonstrates its promise, we will be ready to give even more.  emphasize education. literacy and learning are the foundation of democracy and development. only about 7 percent of world bank resources are devoted to education. this proportion should grow. the united states will increase its own funding for education assistance by at least 20 percent with an emphasis on improving basic education and teacher training in africa. the united states can also bring information technology to these societies, many of whose education systems have been devastated by aids.  continue to aid agricultural development. new technologies, including biotechnology, have enormous potential to improve crop yields in developing countries while using fewer pesticides and less water. using sound science, the united states should help bring these benefits to the 800 million people, including 300 million children, who still suffer from hunger and malnutrition. viii. develop agendas for cooperative action with the other main centers of global power ""we have our best chance since the rise of the nationstate in the 17th century to build a world where the great powers compete in peace instead of prepare for war."" president bush west point, new york june 1, 2002 america will implement its strategies by organizing coalitions  as broad as practicable  of states able and willing to promote a balance of power that favors freedom. effective coalition leadership requires clear priorities, an appreciation of others' interests, and consistent consultations among partners with a spirit of humility. there is little of lasting consequence that the united states can accomplish in the world without the sustained cooperation of its allies and friends in canada and europe. europe is also the seat of two of the strongest and most able international institutions in the world the north atlantic treaty organization (nato), which has, since its inception, been the fulcrum of transatlantic and intereuropean security, and the european union (eu), our partner in opening world trade. the attacks of september 11 were also an attack on nato, as nato itself recognized when it invoked its article v selfdefense clause for the first time. nato's core mission  collective defense of the transatlantic alliance of democracies  remains, but nato must develop new structures and capabilities to carry out that mission under new circumstances. nato must build a capability to field, at short notice, highly mobile, specially trained forces whenever they are needed to respond to a threat against any member of the alliance. the alliance must be able to act wherever our interests are threatened, creating coalitions under nato's own mandate, as well as contributing to missionbased coalitions. to achieve this, we must  expand nato's membership to those democratic nations willing and able to share the burden of defending and advancing our common interests  ensure that the military forces of nato nations have appropriate combat contributions to make in coalition warfare  develop planning processes to enable those contributions to become effective multinational fighting forces  take advantage of the technological opportunities and economies of scale in our defense spending to transform nato military forces so that they dominate potential aggressors and diminish our vulnerabilities  streamline and increase the flexibility of command structures to meet new operational demands and the associated requirements of training, integrating, and experimenting with new force configurations and  maintain the ability to work and fight together as allies even as we take the necessary steps to transform and modernize our forces. if nato succeeds in enacting these changes, the rewards will be a partnership as central to the security and interests of its member states as was the case during the cold war. we will sustain a common perspective on the threats to our societies and improve our ability to take common action in defense of our nations and their interests. at the same time, we welcome our european allies' efforts to forge a greater foreign policy and defense identity with the eu, and commit ourselves to close consultations to ensure that these developments work with nato. we cannot afford to lose this opportunity to better prepare the family of transatlantic democracies for the challenges to come. the attacks of september 11 energized america's asian alliances. australia invoked the anzus treaty to declare the september 11 was an attack on australia itself, following that historic decision with the dispatch of some of the world's finest combat forces for operation enduring freedom. japan and the republic of korea provided unprecedented levels of military logistical support within weeks of the terrorist attack. we have deepened cooperation on counterterrorism with our alliance partners in thailand and the philippines and received invaluable assistance from close friends like singapore and new zealand. the war against terrorism has proven that america's alliances in asia not only underpin regional peace and stability, but are flexible and ready to deal with new challenges. to enhance our asian alliances and friendships, we will  look to japan to continue forging a leading role in regional and global affairs based on our common interests, our common values, and our close defense and diplomatic cooperation  work with south korea to maintain vigilance towards the north while preparing our alliance to make contributions to the broader stability of the region over the longerterm  build on 50 years of u.s.australian alliance cooperation as we continue working together to resolve regional and global problems  as we have so many times from the battle of leyte gulf to tora bora  maintain forces in the region that reflect our commitments to our allies, our requirements, our technological advances, and the strategic environment and  build on stability provided by these alliances, as well as with institutions such as asean and the asiapacific economic cooperation forum, to develop a mix of regional and bilateral strategies to manage change in this dynamic region. we are attentive to the possible renewal of old patterns of great power competition. several potential great powers are now in the midst of internal transition  most importantly russia, india, and china. in all three cases, recent developments have encouraged our hope that a truly global consensus about basic principles is slowly taking shape. with russia, we are already building a new strategic relationship based on a central reality of the twentyfirst century the united states and russia are no longer strategic adversaries. the moscow treaty on strategic reductions is emblematic of this new reality and reflects a critical change in russian thinking that promises to lead to productive, longterm relations with the euroatlantic community and the united states. russia's top leaders have a realistic assessment of their country's current weakness and the policies  internal and external  needed to reverse those weaknesses. they understand, increasingly, that cold war approaches do not serve their national interests and that russian and american strategic interests overlap in many areas. united states policy seeks to use this turn in russian thinking to refocus our relationship on emerging and potential common interests and challenges. we are broadening our already extensive cooperation in the global war on terrorism. we are facilitating russia's entry into the world trade organization, without lowering standards for accession, to promote beneficial bilateral trade and investment relations. we have created the natorussia council with the goal of deepening security cooperation among russia, our european allies, and ourselves. we will continue to bolster the independence and stability of the states of the former soviet union in the belief that a prosperous and stable neighborhood will reinforce russia's growing commitment to integration into the euroatlantic community. at the same time, we are realistic about the differences that still divide us from russia and about the time and effort it will take to build an enduring strategic partnership. lingering distrust of our motives and policies by key russian elites slows improvement in our relations. russia's uneven commitment to the basic values of freemarket democracy and dubious record in combating the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction remain matters of great concern. russia's very weakness limits the opportunities for cooperation. nevertheless, those opportunities are vastly greater now than in recent years  or even decades. the united states has undertaken a transformation in its bilateral relationship with india based on a conviction that u.s. interests require a strong relationship with india. we are the two largest democracies, committed to political freedom protected by representative government. india is moving toward greater economic freedom as well. we have a common interest in the free flow of commerce, including through the vital sea lanes of the indian ocean. finally, we share an interest in fighting terrorism and in creating a strategically stable asia. differences remain, including over the development of india's nuclear and missile programs, and the pace of india's economic reforms. but while in the past these concerns may have dominated our thinking about india, today we start with a view of india as a growing world power with which we have common strategic interests. through a strong partnership with india, we can best address any differences and shape a dynamic future. the united states relationship with china is an important part of our strategy to promote a stable, peaceful, and prosperous asiapacific region. we welcome the emergence of a strong, peaceful, and prosperous china. the democratic development of china is crucial to that future. yet, a quarter century after beginning the process of shedding the worst features of the communist legacy, china's leaders have not yet made the next series of fundamental choices about the character of their state. in pursuing advanced military capabilities that can threaten its neighbors in the asiapacific region, china is following an outdated path that, in the end, will hamper its own pursuit of national greatness. in time, china will find that social and political freedom is the only source of that greatness. the united states seeks a constructive relationship with a changing china. we already cooperate well where our interests overlap, including the current war on terrorism and in promoting stability on the korean peninsula. likewise, we have coordinated on the future of afghanistan and have initiated a comprehensive dialogue on counterterrorism and similar transitional concerns. shared health and environmental threats, such as the spread of hivaids, challenge us to promote jointly the welfare of our citizens. addressing these transnational threats will challenge china to become more open with information, promote the development of civil society, and enhance individual human rights. china has begun to take the road to political openness, permitting many personal freedoms and conducting villagelevel elections, yet remains strongly committed to national oneparty rule by the communist party. to make that nation truly accountable to its citizen's needs and aspirations, however, much work remains to be done. only by allowing the chinese people to think, assemble, and worship freely can china reach its full potential. our important trade relationship will benefit from china's entry into the world trade organization, which will create more export opportunities and ultimately more jobs for american farmers, workers, and companies. china is our fourth largest trading partner, with over $100 billion in annual twoway trade. the power of market principles and the wto's requirements for transparency and accountability will advance openness and the rule of law in china to help establish basic protections for commerce and for citizens. there are, however, other areas in which we have profound disagreements. our commitment to the selfdefense of taiwan under the taiwan relations act is one. human rights is another. we expect china to adhere to its nonproliferation commitments. we will work to narrow differences where they exist, but not allow them to preclude cooperation where we agree. the events of september 11, 2001, fundamentally changed the context for relations between the united states and other main centers of global power, and opened vast, new opportunities. with our longstanding allies in europe and asia, and with leaders in russia, india, and china, we must develop active agendas of cooperation lest these relationships become routine and unproductive. every agency of the united states government shares the challenge. we can build fruitful habits of consultation, quiet argument, sober analysis, and common action. in the longterm, these are the practices that will sustain the supremacy of our common principles and keep open the path of progress. ix. transform america's national security institutions to meet the challenges and opportunities of the twentyfirst century ""terrorists attacked a symbol of american prosperity. they did not touch its source. america is successful because of the hard work, creativity, and enterprise of our people."" president bush washington, d.c. (joint session of congress) september 20, 2001 the major institutions of american national security were designed in a different era to meet different requirements. all of them must be transformed. it is time to reaffirm the essential role of american military strength. we must build and maintain our defenses beyond challenge. our military's highest priority is to defend the united states. to do so effectively, our military must  assure our allies and friends  dissuade future military competition  deter threats against u.s. interests, allies, and friends and  decisively defeat any adversary if deterrence fails. the unparalleled strength of the united states armed forces, and their forward presence, have maintained the peace in some of the world's most strategically vital regions. however, the threats and enemies we must confront have changed, and so must our forces. a military structured to deter massive cold warera armies must be transformed to focus more on how an adversary might fight rather than where and when a war might occur. we will channel our energies to overcome a host of operational challenges. the presence of american forces overseas is one of the most profound symbols of the u.s. commitments to allies and friends. through our willingness to use force in our own defense and in defense of others, the united states demonstrates its resolve to maintain a balance of power that favors freedom. to contend with uncertainty and to meet the many security challenges we face, the united states will require bases and stations within and beyond western europe and northeast asia, as well as temporary access arrangements for the longdistance deployment of u.s. forces. before the war in afghanistan, that area was low on the list of major planning contingencies. yet, in a very short time, we had to operate across the length and breadth of that remote nation, using every branch of the armed forces. we must prepare for more such deployments by developing assets such as advanced remote sensing, longrange precision strike capabilities, and transformed maneuver and expeditionary forces. this broad portfolio of military capabilities must also include the ability to defend the homeland, conduct information operations, ensure u.s. access to distant theaters, and protect critical u.s. infrastructure and assets in outer space. innovation within the armed forces will rest on experimentation with new approaches to warfare, strengthening joint operations, exploiting u.s. intelligence advantages, and taking full advantage of science and technology. we must also transform the way the department of defense is run, especially in financial management and recruitment and retention. finally, while maintaining nearterm readiness and the ability to fight the war on terrorism, the goal must be to provide the president with a wider range of military options to discourage aggression or any form of coercion against the united states, our allies, and our friends. we know from history that deterrence can fail and we know from experience that some enemies cannot be deterred. the united states must and will maintain the capability to defeat any attempt by an enemy  whether a state or nonstate actor  to impose its will on the united states, our allies, or our friends. we will maintain the forces sufficient to support our obligations, and to defend freedom. our forces will be strong enough to dissuade potential adversaries from pursuing a military buildup in hopes of surpassing, or equaling, the power of the united states. intelligence  and how we use it  is our first line of defense against terrorists and the threat posed by hostile states. designed around the priority of gathering enormous information about a massive, fixed object  the soviet bloc  the intelligence community is coping with the challenge of following a far more complex and elusive set of targets. we must transform our intelligence capabilities and build new ones to keep pace with the nature of these threats. intelligence must be appropriately integrated with our defense and law enforcement systems and coordinated with our allies and friends. we need to protect the capabilities we have so that we do not arm our enemies with the knowledge of how best to surprise us. those who would harm us also seek the benefit of surprise to limit our prevention and response options and to maximize injury. we must strengthen intelligence warning and analysis to provide integrated threat assessments for national and homeland security. since the threats inspired by foreign governments and groups may be conducted inside the united states, we must also ensure the proper fusion of information between intelligence and law enforcement. initiatives in this area will include  strengthening the authority of the director of central intelligence to lead the development and actions of the nation's foreign intelligence capabilities  establishing a new framework for intelligence warning that provides seamless and integrated warning across the spectrum of threats facing the nation and our allies  continuing to develop new methods of collecting information to sustain our intelligence advantage  investing in future capabilities while working to protect them through a more vigorous effort to prevent the compromise of intelligence capabilities and  collecting intelligence against the terrorist danger across the government with allsource analysis. as the united states government relies on the armed forces to defend america's interests, it must rely on diplomacy to interact with other nations. we will ensure that the department of state receives funding sufficient to ensure the success of american diplomacy. the state department takes the lead in managing our bilateral relationships with other governments. and in this new era, its people and institutions must be able to interact equally adroitly with nongovernmental organizations and international institutions. officials trained mainly in international politics must also extend their reach to understand complex issues of domestic governance around the world, including public health, education, law enforcement, the judiciary, and public diplomacy. our diplomats serve at the front line of complex negotiations, civil wars, and other humanitarian catastrophes. as humanitarian relief requirements are better understood, we must also be able to help build police forces, court systems, and legal codes, local and provincial government institutions, and electoral systems. effective international cooperation is needed to accomplish these goals, backed by american readiness to play our part. just as our diplomatic institutions must adapt so that we can reach out to others, we also need a different and more comprehensive approach to public information efforts that can help people around the world learn about and understand america. the war on terrorism is not a clash of civilizations. it does, however, reveal the clash inside a civilization, a battle for the future of the muslim world. this is a struggle of ideas and this is an area where america must excel. we will take the actions necessary to ensure that our efforts to meet our global security commitments and protect americans are not impaired by the potential for investigations, inquiry, or prosecution by the international criminal court (icc), whose jurisdiction does not extend to americans and which we do not accept. we will work together with other nations to avoid complications in our military operations and cooperation, through such mechanisms as multilateral and bilateral agreements that will protect u.s. nationals from the icc. we will implement fully the american servicemembers protection act, whose provisions are intended to ensure and enhance the protection of u.s. personnel and officials. we will make hard choices in the coming year and beyond to ensure the right level and allocation of government spending on national security. the united states government must strengthen its defenses to win this war. at home, our most important priority is to protect the homeland for the american people. today, the distinction between domestic and foreign affairs is diminishing. in a globalized world, events beyond america's borders have a greater impact inside them. our society must be open to people, ideas, and goods from across the globe. the characteristics we most cherish  our freedom, our cities, our systems of movement, and modern life  are vulnerable to terrorism. this vulnerability will persist long after we bring to justice those responsible for the september eleventh attacks. as time passes, individuals may gain access to means of destruction that until now could be wielded only by armies, fleets, and squadrons. this is a new condition of life. we will adjust to it and thrive  in spite of it. in exercising our leadership, we will respect the values, judgment, and interests of our friends and partners. still, we will be prepared to act apart when our interests and unique responsibilities require. when we disagree on particulars, we will explain forthrightly the grounds for our concerns and strive to forge viable alternatives. we will not allow such disagreements to obscure our determination to secure together, with our allies and our friends, our shared fundamental interests and values. ultimately, the foundation of american strength is at home. it is in the skills of our people, the dynamism of our economy, and the resilience of our institutions. a diverse, modern society has inherent, ambitious, entrepreneurial energy. our strength comes from what we do with that energy. that is where our national security begins.",[],85701,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""w.h.o. has no knowledge of how these news reports originated,"" said the organization, an agency of the united nations based in geneva, ""but would like to stress that we have no opinion of the future existence of blonds."" all the news reports, in britain and the united states, cited a study from the world health organization  ""a blondeshell study,"" as the daily star of london put it. but none reported any scientific details from the study or the names of the scientists who conducted it. on ""good morning america,"" charles gibson began a conversation with his coanchor, diane sawyer, by saying ""there's a study from the world health organization, this is for real, that blonds are an endangered species. women and men with blond hair, eyebrows and blue eyes, natural blonds, they say will vanish from the face of the earth within 200 years, because it is not as strong a gene as brunets."" ms. sawyer said she was ""somewhat of a natural blonde."" jeffrey schneider, a spokesman for abc news, said the anchors got the information from an abc producer in london who said he had read it in a british newspaper. in london, the sun and the express both reported that unnamed scientists said blonds would survive longest in scandinavia, where they are most concentrated, and expected the last true blond to hail from finland. the british accounts were replete with the views of bleached blonds who said hairdressers would never allow blondness to become extinct, and doctors who said that rare genes would pop up to keep natural blonds from becoming an endangered species. journalists in london said last night that the source of the reports was probably one of several european news agencies that are used by the british press, but it remained unclear which one. tim hall, a night news editor at the daily mail, said the report was probably distributed by the press association, britain's domestic news agency. ""several papers picked it up,"" he said. but charlotte gapper, night editor at the press association, said that although it had considered running the report on sept. 27, it had decided not to after talking to the world health organization. ""we didn't do that story because we made an inquiry to the world health organization first,"" she said. ""they told us that report was two years old, and had been covered at the time. they said it had been picked up again that day by a german news agency."" she added that she did not know which agency the organization was referring to. dr. ray white, a geneticist at the university of california at san francisco, said that the disappearance of a gene for blond hair ""sounds patently incorrect."" how to advertise  for information on advertising in email newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with the new york times on the web, please contact or visit our online media kit at for general information about nytimes.com, write to copyright 2002 the new york times company",[],4313,0,0,easy_ham_testing

government boondoggle, expropriated from the original preconstruction property owners at the behest of a thirdgeneration trustfundaristocrat for the ""good"" of the city, and owned by an ""authority"" looking for something else to do after it, and its coachhounds in organized labor and organized crime, had killed what was the largest port in the world's richest nation. now, of course, it's about to get worse. the sins of 40 years ago have been compounded at the hands of two kinds of literally irrational fanatics, first those in religion, and now those in government. as a result, a large part of 10 million square feet of once perfectly usable office space, devoted, at least ostensibly, to commerce, will be ""granted"" away in a potlatch that only government, and specialinterest ""communities"", (or ""stakeholders"", or whatever the cryptosocialist psychorabble call themselves this week) can organize to such perfection. all this in probably the only city in the country that was founded by a business, explicitly for the purpose of commerce. not religious fanaticism. not colonial expansion in a monarch's name. commerce. if they really wanted to make a point to the superstitious luddites who collapsed those buildings (using probably the only sharp objects on a plane full of governmentdisarmed passengers) the socalled ""authority"" should disband itself and sell its property off to the highest bidder and let the market  the cure to all luddism, foreign and domestic, government and superstitious  decide. if the new, private owner wants to sell, or give away, a space for a memorial, fine. they could sell tickets and donate the money to the families of the dead and injured. probably great for marketing the property, at least during the lifetime of anyone who remembers the event. and, of course, if the new owner wants to build something twice as tall, or with twice as much space than the original 10 million square feet, splendid. whatever the market will bear. in these days of increasingly ubiquitous transnational geodesic internetworks, of strong financial cryptography, and of exponentially decreasing transaction costs in formerly monolithic industries, economics and freedom can, and will, prevail over both superstition and statism. it's probably too much to hope for an actual market in lower manhattan megarealestate to prevail this early in the game, but it's going to happen sooner or later. and, whenever it does, that will be a fitting memorial to those who died at the world trade center. cheers, rah   the wall street journal september 11, 2002 review  outlook a living memorial as we write these words, we can look down from our offices into the sixstory crater where the twin towers once stood. like everyone else, we want that site to be rebuilt in a way that honors those who died a year ago. but we also think the best memorial to those who perished would be a living one. the site of the world trade center calls forth many emotions, especially today anger, grief and respect for the many acts of heroism that took place there. but underlying it all is the memory of the enormous vitality that distinguished the towers before they were attacked and was a large reason they were targeted. the best expression of the spirit of new york and of those who died would be to once again see thousands of people from dozens of countries working, meeting, shopping, eating  that is, engaged in the sort of productive work and play that used to take place there. osama bin laden should not be allowed to have turned it into a cemetery. but restoring this memory is not what the discussion in new york has been about. so far no one is talking seriously about the vigorous rebuilding of downtown manhattan, which lost 100,000 jobs when the trade center fell. instead the discussion centers on the size and scale of the memorial, and on satisfying every political interest now clamoring for a piece of the action. new york's political leadership, and its financial and media elites, are squandering a historic chance to rebuild a better, more prosperous city. this is in part the fault of the commission tasked with figuring out what to do with the site. in consultation with new york governor george pataki, who is thinking primarily about his own november reelection, the commission made the decision to focus first on the memorial. the manhattan institute's steve malanga argues that the commission would have been better off setting aside a limited space for the memorial, getting on with the rebuilding and then returning to the memorial. this is in essence what the pentagon has so successfully done  rebuild immediately and set aside two acres for an outdoor memorial, a design for which has yet to be decided. a big part of the problem in new york is that the city's antidevelopment activists know an opening when they see one. they want the world trade center site  and even some surrounding areas   transformed into an enormous park. these political advocates have had plenty of practice at turning proposed development projects in new york into a nightmare of delay and litigation, and the world trade center site is now getting the same treatment. worse, they are cynically using some bereaved family members to advance their own antidevelopment agenda in the name of ""honoring"" the dead. one family group even called a press conference to reject as disrespectful a proposed train line under the site. we are not experts in designing war memorials, but we're confident that a gigantic park in the heart of the world's financial center isn't the appropriate choice for those who died a year ago. the great cities of europe and japan, devastated in world war ii, have all rebuilt, and with memorials that are integrated into modern urban life. perhaps the most powerful is found in rotterdam, the dutch port city reduced to rubble by german bombing, where survivors erected a statue of a man with a hole where his heart used to be. in this country, the practice has been for the names of war dead to be inscribed on the walls of institutions with which they were affiliated. if you walk into nassau hall at princeton university, you'll find the names of 644 alumni who died in the revolutionary war, the war of 1812, the civil war, the spanishamerican war, world war i, world war ii, korea and southeast asia. no one thinks it disrespectful to the dead that the life of the university goes on around the walls containing their names. in new york now, it would help if political leaders looked beyond the emotional tug of the victims and their families to the city's future. rudolph giuliani, now that he's out office, wants the entire 16 acres devoted to the memorial. governor pataki has called for no structures on the ""footprints,"" which, being in the center of the site, would severely curtail options. mayor michael bloomberg initially raised his voice in favor of commercial development but was bloodied by the press and has since ducked for cover. maybe things will be different after this anniversary is past. maybe those responsible for the world trade center site will start thinking more about the next 50 or 100 years than the past 12 months. the best way to honor the dead is by reviving normal life and commerce. begin pgp signature version pgp 7.5

""billy in the bowl"", however, wasn't satisfied with becoming the daily owner of a generous number of small coins what his greed demanded were substantial sums of money. the more he managed to get the more he could indulge in his pet vices  gambling and drinking. as a result the beggar evolved a plan to rob unsuspecting sympathisers. the first time lie put his plan into operation was on a cold march evening as dusk, was falling. the victim was a middle aged woman who was passing through grangegorman lane on her way to visit friends in queen street  on dublin's north quays. when billy heard the woman's footsteps, he hid behind some bushes in a ditch which skirted the lane. as his unsuspecting victim drew close, the beggar moaned and shouted, and cried out for help. trembling with excitement, the woman dashed to the spot where billy lay concealed. she bent down to help the beggar out of the ditch, when two powerful arms closed around her throat and pulled her into the bushes. in a few minutes it was all over. the woman lay in a dead faint, and billy was travelling at a fast rate down the lane in his "" bowl "", his victirn's purse snug in his coat pocket. an hour after the robbery the woman was found in a distracted condition, but failed to give a description of her assailant. and, as ""billy in the bowl"" had figured, nobody would suspect a deformed beggar. again and again the beggar carried out his robbery plan, always shifting the place of attack to a different part of grangegorman or stoneybatter. on one occasion "" billy in ""the bowl "" tried his tactics on a sturdy servant girl who put up such a vigorous resistance that he was forced to strangle her. the incident became known as the 11 grangegorman lane murder and caused a great stir. hundred.s flocked to the scene of the crime and for a couple of months ""billy in the bowl"" was forced to desert his usual haunts. around this period, dublin's firstever police force was been mobilised, and the first case they were confronted with was the grangegorman lane murder. months passed and ""billy in the bowl"" reverted once again to his old pasttime. a number of young servant girls were lured into ditches and robbed, and the police were inundated with so many complaints that a nightly patrol was placed on the district. but the beggar still rolled along in his ""bowl"" pitied and unsuspected. then came the night that finished billy's career of crime. two stoudy built female cooks, trudging back to their places of employment after a night out in the city, were surprised and not a little shocked to hear shouts for help. rushing over, they came upon a huddled figure in the ditch. billy, thinking there was only one woman, grabbed one of the cooks and tried to pull her into the ditch. she proved much too strong for him, however) and while resisting tore 'at his face with her sharp fingernails. meanwhile, her companion acted with speed and daring. pulling out her large hatpin she made .for the beggar, and plunged the pin into his right eye. the screams and howls of the wounded beggar reverberated throughout the district and brought people dashing to the scene. among them was a member of the nightly police patrol who promptly arrested the groaning billy. ""billy in the bowl"" was tried and sentenced for robbery with violence, but they could never prove it was he who had strangled the servant girl. the grangegormanstoneybatter district became once again a quiet, attractive dublin suburb where old ladies strolled, and carefree servant girls laughed and giggled as they wended their way home at night. daev  rev. dave 'daev' walsh, home weekly rant 'is it about a bicycle?'sgt.pluck, 'the third policeman', by flann o'brien  holistic pet detective, owl worrier, snark hunter",[],6213,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(donald rumsfeld, the secretary of defense, shares these characteristics, and has been closely associated with cheney for more than thirty years.) colin powell, then the chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, mounted a competing, and presumably more ideologically moderate, effort to reimagine american foreign policy and defense. a date was setmay 21, 1990on which each team would brief cheney for an hour cheney would then brief president bush, after which bush would make a foreignpolicy address unveiling the new grand strategy. everybody worked for months on the ""fivetwentyone brief,"" with a sense that the shape of the postcold war world was at stake. when wolfowitz and powell arrived at cheney's office on may 21st, wolfowitz went first, but his briefing lasted far beyond the allotted hour, and cheney (a hawk who, perhaps, liked what he was hearing) did not call time on him. powell didn't get to present his alternate version of the future of the united states in the world until a couple of weeks later. cheney briefed president bush, using material mostly from wolfowitz, and bush prepared his major foreignpolicy address. but he delivered it on august 2, 1990, the day that iraq invaded kuwait, so nobody noticed. the team kept working. in 1992, the times got its hands on a version of the material, and published a frontpage story saying that the pentagon envisioned a future in which the united states could, and should, prevent any other nation or alliance from becoming a great power. a few weeks of controversy ensued about the bush administration's hawks being ""unilateral""controversy that cheney's people put an end to with denials and the counterleak of an edited, softer version of the same material. as it became apparent that bush was going to lose to clinton, the cheney team's efforts took on the quality of a parting shot. the report that the senior official handed me at lunch had been issued only a few days before clinton took office. it is a somewhat bland, opaque documenta ""scrubbed,"" meaning unclassified, version of something more candidbut it contained the essential ideas of ""shaping,"" rather than reacting to, the rest of the world, and of preventing the rise of other superpowers. its tone is one of skepticism about diplomatic partnerships. a more forthright version of the same ideas can be found in a short book titled ""from containment to global leadership?,"" which zalmay khalilzad, who joined cheney's team in 1991 and is now special envoy to afghanistan, published a couple of years into the clinton administration, when he was out of government. it recommends that the united states ""preclude the rise of another global rival for the indefinite future."" khalilzad writes, ""it is a vital u.s. interest to preclude such a developmenti.e., to be willing to use force if necessary for the purpose."" when george w. bush was campaigning for president, he and the people around him didn't seem to be proposing a great doctrinal shift, along the lines of the policy of containment of the soviet union's sphere of influence which the united states maintained during the cold war. in his first major foreignpolicy speech, delivered in november of 1999, bush declared that ""a president must be a cleareyed realist,"" a formulation that seems to connote an absence of worldremaking ambition. ""realism"" is exactly the foreignpolicy doctrine that cheney's pentagon team rejected, partly because it posits the impossibility of any one country's ever dominating world affairs for any length of time. one gets many reminders in washington these days of how much the terrorist attacks of september 11th have changed official foreignpolicy thinking. any chief executive, of either party, would probably have done what bush has done so farmade war on the taliban and al qaeda and enhanced domestic security. it is only now, six months after the attacks, that we are truly entering the realm of presidential choice, and all indications are that bush is going to use september 11th as the occasion to launch a new, aggressive american foreign policy that would represent a broad change in direction rather than a specific war on terrorism. all his rhetoric, especially in the two addresses he has given to joint sessions of congress since september 11th, and all the information about his state of mind which his aides have leaked, indicate that he sees this as the nation's moment of destinya perception that the people around him seem to be encouraging, because it enhances bush's stature and opens the way to more assertive policymaking. inside government, the reason september 11th appears to have been ""a transformative moment,"" as the senior official i had lunch with put it, is not so much that it revealed the existence of a threat of which officials had previously been unaware as that it drastically reduced the american public's usual resistance to american military involvement overseas, at least for a while. the clinton administration, beginning with the ""black hawk down"" operation in mogadishu, during its first year, operated on the conviction that americans were highly averse to casualties the allbombing kosovo operation, in clinton's nexttolast year, was the ideal foreign military adventure. now that the united states has been attacked, the options are much broader. the senior official approvingly mentioned a 1999 study of casualty aversion by the triangle institute for security studies, which argued that the ""mass public"" is much less casualtyaverse than the military or the civilian lite believes for example, the study showed that the public would tolerate thirty thousand deaths in a military operation to prevent iraq from acquiring weapons of mass destruction. (the american death total in the vietnam war was about fiftyeight thousand.) september 11th presumably reduced casualty aversion even further. recently, i went to the white house to interview condoleezza rice. rice's foreign affairs article from 2000 begins with this declaration ""the united states has found it exceedingly difficult to define its 'national interest' in the absence of soviet power."" i asked her whether that is still the case. ""i think the difficulty has passed in defining a role,"" she said immediately. ""i think september 11th was one of those great earthquakes that clarify and sharpen. events are in much sharper relief."" like bush, she said that opposing terrorism and preventing the accumulation of weapons of mass destruction ""in the hands of irresponsible states"" now define the national interest. (the latter goal, by the way, is newin bush's speech to congress on september 20th, america's sole grand purpose was ending terrorism.) we talked in her west wing office its tall windows face the part of the white house grounds where television reporters do their standups. in her bearing, rice seemed less crisply military than she does in public. she looked a little tired, but she was projecting a kind of missionary calm, rather than belligerence. in the foreign affairs article, rice came across as a classic realist, putting forth ""the notions of power politics, great powers, and power balances"" as the proper central concerns of the united states. now she sounded as if she had moved closer to the onepower idea that cheney's pentagon team proposed ten years agoor, at least, to the idea that the other great powers are now in harmony with the united states, because of the terrorist attacks, and can be induced to remain so. ""theoretically, the realists would predict that when you have a great power like the united states it would not be long before you had other great powers rising to challenge it or trying to balance against it,"" rice said. ""and i think what you're seeing is that there's at least a predilection this time to move to productive and coperative relations with the united states, rather than to try to balance the united states. i actually think that statecraft matters in how it all comes out. it's not all foreordained."" rice said that she had called together the senior staff people of the national security council and asked them to think seriously about ""how do you capitalize on these opportunities"" to fundamentally change american doctrine, and the shape of the world, in the wake of september 11th. ""i really think this period is analogous to 1945 to 1947,"" she saidthat is, the period when the containment doctrine took shape""in that the events so clearly demonstrated that there is a big global threat, and that it's a big global threat to a lot of countries that you would not have normally thought of as being in the coalition. that has started shifting the tectonic plates in international politics. and it's important to try to seize on that and position american interests and institutions and all of that before they harden again."" the national security council is legally required to produce an annual document called the national security strategy, stating the overall goals of american policyanother government report whose importance is great but not obvious. the bush administration did not produce one last year, as the clinton administration did not in its first year. rice said that she is working on the report now. ""there are two ways to handle this document,"" she told me. ""one is to do it in a kind of minimalist way and just get it out. but it's our view that, since this is going to be the first one for the bush administration, it's important. an awful lot has happened since we started this process, prior to 911. i can't give you a certain date when it's going to be out, but i would think sometime this spring. and it's important that it be a real statement of what the bush administration sees as the strategic direction that it's going."" it seems clear already that rice will set forth the hope of a more dominant american role in the world than she might have a couple of years ago. some questions that don't appear to be settled yet, but are obviously being asked, are how much the united states is willing to operate alone in foreign affairs, and how much change it is willing to try to engender inside other countriesand to what end, and with what means. the leak a couple of weeks ago of a new american nuclear posture, adding offensive capability against ""rogue states,"" departed from decades of official adherence to a purely defensive position, and was just one indication of the scope of the reconsideration that is going on. is the united states now in a position to be redrawing regional maps, especially in the middle east, and replacing governments by force? nobody thought that the bush administration would be thinking in such ambitious terms, but plainly it is, and with the internal debate to the right of where it was only a few months ago. just before the 2000 election, a republican foreignpolicy figure suggested to me that a good indication of a bush administration's direction in foreign affairs would be who got a higherranking job, paul wolfowitz or richard haass. haass is another veteran of the first bush administration, and an intellectual like wolfowitz, but much more moderate. in 1997, he published a book titled ""the reluctant sheriff,"" in which he poked a little fun at wolfowitz's famous strategy briefing of the early nineties (he called it the ""pentagon paper"") and disagreed with its idea that the united states should try to be the world's only great power over the long term. ""for better or worse, such a goal is beyond our reach,"" haass wrote. ""it simply is not doable."" elsewhere in the book, he disagreed with another of the wolfowitz team's main ideas, that of the united states expanding the ""democratic zone of peace"" ""primacy is not to be confused with hegemony. the united states cannot compel others to become more democratic."" haass argued that the united states is becoming less dominant in the world, not more, and suggested ""a revival of what might be called traditional greatpower politics."" wolfowitz got a higherranking job than haass he is deputy secretary of defense, and haass is director of policy planning for the state department in effect, colin powell's bigthink guy. recently, i went to see him in his office at the state department. on the wall of his waiting room was an array of photographs of every past director of the policyplanning staff, beginning with george kennan, the father of the containment doctrine and the first holder of the office that haass now occupies. it's another indication of the way things are moving in washington that haass seems to have become more hawkish. i mentioned the title of his book. ""using the word 'reluctant' was itself reflective of a period when foreign policy seemed secondary, and sacrificing for foreign policy was a hard case to make,"" he said. ""it was written when bill clinton was saying, 'it's the economy, stupid'not 'it's the world, stupid.' two things are very different now. one, the president has a much easier time making the case that foreign policy matters. second, at the top of the nationalsecurity charts is this notion of weapons of mass destruction and terrorism."" i asked haass whether there is a doctrine emerging that is as broad as kennan's containment. ""i think there is,"" he said. ""what you're seeing from this administration is the emergence of a new principle or body of ideasi'm not sure it constitutes a doctrineabout what you might call the limits of sovereignty. sovereignty entails obligations. one is not to massacre your own people. another is not to support terrorism in any way. if a government fails to meet these obligations, then it forfeits some of the normal advantages of sovereignty, including the right to be left alone inside your own territory. other governments, including the united states, gain the right to intervene. in the case of terrorism, this can even lead to a right of preventive, or peremptory, selfdefense. you essentially can act in anticipation if you have grounds to think it's a question of when, and not if, you're going to be attacked."" clearly, haass was thinking of iraq. ""i don't think the american public needs a lot of persuading about the evil that is saddam hussein,"" he said. ""also, i'd fully expect the president and his chief lieutenants to make the case. public opinion can be changed. we'd be able to make the case that this isn't a discretionary action but one done in selfdefense."" on the larger issue of the american role in the world, haass was still maintaining some distance from the hawks. he had made a speech not long before called ""imperial america,"" but he told me that there is a big difference between imperial and imperialist. ""i just think that we have to be a little bit careful,"" he said. ""great as our advantages are, there are still limits. we have to have allies. we can't impose our ideas on everyone. we don't want to be fighting wars alone, so we need others to join us. american leadership, yes but not american unilateralism. it has to be multilateral. we can't win the war against terror alone. we can't send forces everywhere. it really does have to be a collaborative endeavor."" he stopped for a moment. ""is there a successor idea to containment? i think there is,"" he said. ""it is the idea of integration. the goal of u.s. foreign policy should be to persuade the other major powers to sign on to certain key ideas as to how the world should operate opposition to terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, support for free trade, democracy, markets. integration is about locking them into these policies and then building institutions that lock them in even more."" the first, but by no means the last, obvious manifestation of a new american foreign policy will be the effort to remove saddam hussein. what the united states does in an iraq operation will very likely dwarf what's been done so far in afghanistan, both in terms of the scale of the operation itself and in terms of its aftermath. several weeks ago, ahmad chalabi, the head of the iraqi national congress, the iraqi opposition party, came through washington with an entourage of his aides. chalabi went to the state department and the white house to ask, evidently successfully, for more american funding. his main public event was a panel discussion at the american enterprise institute. chalabi's leading supporter in town, richard perle, the prominent hawk and former defense department official, acted as moderator. smiling and supremely confident, perle opened the discussion by saying, ""evidence is mounting that the administration is looking very carefully at strategies for dealing with saddam hussein."" the war on terrorism, he said, will not be complete ""until saddam is successfully dealt with. and that means replacing his regime. . . . that action will be taken, i have no doubt."" chalabi, who lives in london, is a charming, suave middleaged man with a twinkle in his eye. he was dressed in a doublebreasted pinstriped suit and a striped shirt with a white spread collar. although he and his supporters argue that the iraqi national congress, with sufficient american support, can defeat saddam just as the northern alliance defeated the taliban in afghanistan, this view hasn't won over most people in washington. it isn't just that chalabi doesn't look the part of a rebel military leader (""he could fight you for the last petit four on the tray over tea at the savoy, but that's about it,"" one skeptical former pentagon official told me), or that he isn't in iraq. it's also that saddam's military is perhaps ten times the size that the taliban's was, and has been quite successful at putting down revolts over the last decade. the united states left iraq in 1991 believing that saddam might soon fall to an internal rebellion chalabi's supporters believe that saddam is much weaker now, and that even signs that a serious operation was in the offing could finish him off. but nontrue believers seem to be coming around to the idea that a military operation against saddam would mean the deployment of anywhere from a hundred thousand to three hundred thousand american ground troops. kenneth pollack, a former c.i.a. analyst who was the national security council's staff expert on iraq during the last years of the clinton administration, recently caused a stir in the foreignpolicy world by publishing an article in foreign affairs calling for war against saddam. this was noteworthy because three years ago pollack and two coauthors published an article, also in foreign affairs, arguing that the iraqi national congress was incapable of defeating saddam. pollack still doesn't think chalabi can do the job. he believes that it would require a substantial american ground, air, and sea force, closer in size to the one we used in kuwait in 199091 than to the one we are using now in afghanistan. pollack, who is trim, quick, and crisp, is obviously a man who has given a briefing or two in his day. when i went to see him at his office in washington, with a little encouragement he got out from behind his desk and walked over to his office wall, where three maps of the middle east were hanging. ""the only way to do it is a fullscale invasion,"" he said, using a pen as a pointer. ""we're talking about two grand corps, two to three hundred thousand people altogether. the population is here, in the tigriseuphrates valley."" he pointed to the area between baghdad and basra. ""ideally, you'd have the saudis on board."" he pointed to the prince sultan airbase, near riyadh. ""you could make kuwait the base, but it's much easier in saudi. you need to take western iraq and southern iraq""pointing again""because otherwise they'll fire scuds at israel and at the saudi oil fields. you probably want to prevent iraq from blowing up its own oil fields, so troops have to occupy them. and you need troops to defend the kurds in northern iraq."" point, point.

""you get the enemy to divide his forces, by threatening him in two places at once."" his hand hit the desk again, hard. ""then you crush him."" smack. that would be a reverberating blow. the united states has already removed the government of one country, afghanistan, the new government is obviously shaky, and american military operations there are not completed. pakistan, which before september 11th clearly met the new test of national unacceptability (it both harbors terrorists and has weapons of mass destruction), will also require longterm attention, since the country is not wholly under the control of the government, as the murder of daniel pearl demonstrated, and even parts of the government, like the intelligence service, may not be entirely under the control of the president. in iraq, if america invades and brings down saddam, a new government must be establishedan enormous longterm task in a country where there is no obvious, plausible new leader. the prospective iraq operation has drawn strong objections from the neighboring nations, one of which, russia, is a nuclear superpower. an invasion would have a huge effect on the internal affairs of all the biggest middle eastern nations iran, turkey, saudi arabia, and even egypt. events have forced the administration to become directly involved in the israelipalestinian conflict, as it hadn't wanted to do. so it's really the entire region that is in play, in much the way that europe was immediately after the second world war. in september, bush rejected paul wolfowitz's recommendation of immediate moves against iraq. that the president seems to have changed his mind is an indication, in part, of the bureaucratic skill of the administration's conservatives. ""these guys are relentless,"" one former official, who is close to the high command at the state department, told me. ""resistance is futile."" the conservatives' other weapon, besides relentlessness, is intellectualism. colin powell tends to think case by case, and since september 11th the conservatives have outflanked him by producing at least the beginning of a coherent, hawkish world view whose acceptance practically requires invading iraq. if the united states applies the doctrines of cheney's old pentagon team, ""shaping"" and expanding ""the zone of democracy,"" the implications would extend far beyond that one operation. the outside experts on the middle east who have the most credibility with the administration seem to be bernard lewis, of princeton, and fouad ajami, of the johns hopkins school of advanced international studies, both of whom see the arab middle east as a region in need of radical remediation. lewis was invited to the white house in december to brief the senior foreignpolicy staff. ""one point he made is, look, in that part of the world, nothing matters more than resolute will and force,"" the senior official i had lunch with told mein other words, the united states needn't proceed gingerly for fear of inflaming the ""arab street,"" as long as it is prepared to be strong. the senior official also recommended as interesting thinkers on the middle east charles hill, of yale, who in a recent essay declared, ""every regime of the arabislamic world has proved a failure,"" and reuel marc gerecht, of the american enterprise institute, who published an article in the weekly standard about the need for a change of regime in iran and syria. (those goals, gerecht told me when we spoke, could be accomplished through pressure short of an invasion.) several people i spoke with predicted that most, or even all, of the nations that loudly oppose an invasion of iraq would privately cheer it on, if they felt certain that this time the americans were really going to finish the job. one purpose of vicepresident cheney's recent diplomatic tour of the region was to offer assurances on that matter, while gamely absorbing all the public criticism of an iraq operation. in any event, the administration appears to be committed to acting forcefully in advance of the world's approval. when i spoke to condoleezza rice, she said that the united states should assemble ""coalitions of the willing"" to support its actions, rather than feel it has to work within the existing infrastructure of international treaties and organizations. an invasion of iraq would test that policy in more ways than one the administration would be betting that it can continue to eliminate al qaeda cells in countries that publicly opposed the iraq operation. when the administration submitted its budget earlier this year, it asked for a fortyeightbilliondollar increase in defense spending for fiscal 2003, which begins in october, 2002. much of that sum would go to improve military pay and benefits, but ten billion dollars of it is designated as an unspecified contingency fund for further operations in the war on terrorism. that's probably at least the initial funding for an invasion of iraq. this spring, the administration will be talking to other countries about the invasion, trying to secure basing and overflight privileges, while bush builds up a rhetorical case for it by giving speeches about the unacceptability of developing weapons of mass destruction. a drama involving weapons inspections in iraq will play itself out over the spring and summer, and will end with the united states declaring that the terms that saddam offers for the inspections, involving delays and restrictions, are unacceptable. then, probably in the late summer or early fall, the enormous troop positioning, which will take months, will begin. the administration obviously feels confident that the united states can effectively parry whatever aggressive actions saddam takes during the troop buildup, and hopes that its moves will destabilize iraq enough to cause the republican guard, the military key to the country, to turn against saddam and topple him on its own. but the chain of events leading inexorably to a fullscale american invasion, if it hasn't already begun, evidently will begin soon. lewis (scooter) libby, who was the principal drafter of cheney's futureoftheworld documents during the first bush administration, now works in an office in the old executive office building, overlooking the west wing, where he has a second, smaller office. a packet of publicrelations material prompted by the recent paperback publication of his 1996 novel, ""the apprentice,"" quotes the times' calling him ""dick cheney's dick cheney,"" which seems like an apt description he appears absolutely sure of himself, and, whether by coincidence or as a result of the influence of his boss, speaks in a tough, confidential, gravelly rumble. like condoleezza rice and bush himself, he gives the impression of having calmly accepted the idea that the project of war and reconstruction which the administration has now taken on may be a little exhausting for those charged with carrying it out but is unquestionably right, the only truly prudent course. when i went to see libby, not long ago, i asked him whether, before september 11th, american policy toward terrorism should have been different. he went to his desk and got out a large black looseleaf binder, filled with typewritten sheets interspersed with foldout maps of the middle east. he looked through it for a long minute, formulating his answer. ""let us stack it up,"" he said at last. ""somalia, 1993 1994, the discovery of the al qaedarelated plot in the philippines 1993, the world trade center, first bombing 1993, the attempt to assassinate president bush, former president bush, and the lack of response to that, the lack of a serious response to that 1995, the riyadh bombing 1996, the khobar bombing 1998, the kenyan embassy bombing and the tanzanian embassy bombing 1999, the plot to launch millennium attacks 2000, the bombing of the cole. throughout this period, infractions on inspections by the iraqis, and eventually the withdrawal of the entire inspection regime and the failure to respond significantly to iraqi incursions in the kurdish areas. no one would say these challenges posed easy problems, but if you take that long list and you ask, 'did we respond in a way which discouraged people from supporting terrorist activities, or activities clearly against our interests? did we help to shape the environment in a way which discouraged further aggressions against u.s. interests?,' many observers conclude no, and ask whether it was then easier for someone like osama bin laden to rise up and say credibly, 'the americans don't have the stomach to defend themselves. they won't take casualties to defend their interests. they are morally weak.' "" libby insisted that the american response to september 11th has not been standard or foreordained. ""look at what the president has done in afghanistan,"" he said, ""and look at his speech to the joint session of congress""meaning the state of the union message, in january. ""he made it clear that it's an important area. he made it clear that we believe in expanding the zone of democracy even in this difficult part of the world. he made it clear that we stand by our friends and defend our interests. and he had the courage to identify those states which present a problem, and to begin to build consensus for action that would need to be taken if there is not a change of behavior on their part. take the afghan case, for example. there are many other courses that the president could have taken. he could have waited for juridical proof before we responded. he could have engaged in long negotiations with the taliban. he could have failed to seek a new relationship with pakistan, based on its past nuclear tests, or been so afraid of weakening pakistan that we didn't seek its help. this list could go on to twice or three times the length i've mentioned so far. but, instead, the president saw an opportunity to refashion relations while standing up for our interests. the problem is complex, and we don't know yet how it will end, but we have opened new prospects for relations not only with afghanistan, as important as it was as a threat, but with the states of central asia, pakistan, russia, and, as it may develop, with the states of southwest asia more generally."" we moved on to iraq, and the question of what makes saddam hussein unacceptable, in the administration's eyes. ""the issue is not inspections,"" libby said. ""the issue is the iraqis' promise not to have weapons of mass destruction, their promise to recognize the boundaries of kuwait, their promise not to threaten other countries, and other promises that they made in '91, and a number of u.n. resolutions, including all the other problems i listed. whether it was wise or notand that is the subject of debateiraq was given a second chance to abide by international norms. it failed to take that chance then, and annually for the next ten years."" ""what's your level of confidence,"" i asked him, ""that the current regime will, in fact, change its behavior in a way that you will be satisfied by?"" he ran his hand over his face and then gave me a direct gaze and spoke slowly and deliberately. ""there is no basis in iraq's past behavior to have confidence in goodfaith efforts on their part to change their behavior.""   r. a. hettinga mailto the internet bearer underwriting corporation  44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa ""... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, predicting the end of the world has not been found agreeable to experience.""  edward gibbon, 'decline and fall of the roman empire'",[],35056,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(or list if you'd rather, although making it a  tuple has the nice sideeffect of forcing you to play nice with my  dbdict class).   i hope doing this sort of optimization isn't too far distant from the  goal of this project, even though readme.txt says it is )   diff attached. i'm not comfortable checking this in, i think it's healthy that you're uncomfortable checking things in with    xxx kludge kludge kludge. comments wink.  since i don't really like how it works (i'd rather just get rid of wordinfo).  but i guess it proves the point ) i'm not interested in optimizing anything yet, and get many benefits from the ease of working with utterly vanilla python instance objects. lots of code all over picks these apart for display and analysis purposes. very few people have tried this code yet, and there are still many questions about it (see, e.g., jeremy's writeup of his disappointing firsttime experiences today). let's keep it as easy as possible to modify for now. if you're desparate to save memory, write a subclass? other people are free to vote in other directions, of course wink.",[],1838,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""first and most important of these traits is that cranks work in almost total isolation . . . in the sense of having no fruitful contacts with fellow researchers. . . . the modern crank insists that his isolation is not desired on his part. it is due, he claims, to the prejudice of established scientific groups against new ideas. . . . ""the modern pseudoscientist . . . stands entirely outside the closely integrated channels through which new ideas are introduced and evaluated. he works in isolation. he does not send his findings to the recognized journals, or if he does, they are rejected for reasons which in the vast majority of cases are excellent. in most cases, the crank is not well enough informed to write a paper with even a surface resemblance to a significant study. as a consequence, he finds himself excluded the journals and societies, and almost universally ignored by the competent workers in his field. in fact, the reputable scientist does not even know of the crank's existence unless his work is given widespread publicity through nonacademic channels, or unless the scientist makes a hobby of collecting crank literature. the eccentric is forced, therefore, to tread a lonely way. he speaks before organizations he himself has founded, contributes to journals he himself may edit, and  until recently  publishes books only when he or his followers can raise sufficient funds to have them printed privately. ""a second characteristic of the pseudo scientist, which greatly strengthens his isolation, is a tendency toward paranoia. . . . ""there are five ways in which the sincere pseudo scientist's paranoid tendencies are likely to be exhibited. ""(1) he considers himself a genius. ""(2) he regards his colleagues, without exception, as ignorant blockheads. everyone is out of step except himself. frequently he insults his opponents by accusing them of stupidity, dishonesty, or other base motives. if they ignore him, he takes this to mean his arguments are unanswerable. if they retaliate in kind, this strengthens his delusion that he is battling scoundrels. . . . ""(3) he believes himself unjustly persecuted and discriminated against. . . . ""(4) he has a strong compulsion to focus his attacks on the greatest scientists and the best established theories. when newton was the outstanding name in physics, eccentric works in that science were violently anti newton. today, with einstein the father symbol of authority, a crank theory of physics is likely to attack einstein in the name of newton. . . .

see end of post (i think that i've done a far better job than the google translation  at least it's readable now  any corrections appreciated). stuff in 's is my (and others) additions to the debate. my apologies if i've paraphrased anybody incorrectly, i will be glad to retract if anyone is miffed. the article makes four main points. 1) absence of critical clauses. in this case, the idea is that the licence is invalid because it doesn't specify under what country's law the gpl is governed. 2) specification in english only. that for the end user (as opposed to businesses), the gpl doesn't apply because it's not written in french. 3) arbitary licence change. the point here is that (under french law) the author can change the terms of the licence arbitarily. this is because any granting of rights by an author must be clearly delimited in terms of how long, where, to whom, dates and times. in the absence of such limitations, the original author has the right to change his software back to closed on a whim.  david neary makes the point that the copyright holder automatically retains the right to change the licence. scott replies it simply requires authorisation from all copyright holders that's not my understanding. french law allows a gpl type licence on condition that the specific conditions of the granting of such rights are clear  if they are not, there is nothing to stop the original author taking back ""his work"". the lawyers see this (correctly imho) as a weakness in the gpl).  4) hidden defects. roughly, this clause means that the author(s) isare liable for any defects if the consumer is not an it engineer, so if linux blows up and data is lost, then the authors are liable.  ciaran johnson says that m$oft and others have similar clauses  the point here is that they are all invalid  just that this one affects the gpl also. niall o'broinn makes the point that it is not a sale, but rather a serviceleasing arrangement and that's why it doesn't come under this point. i would suggest that the whole thrust of this article has been to see software ""sales"" (even if no money changes hands) as governed very much by consumer law (in france anyway). rick moen makes the point that it is not a sale but rather a granting of rights which are not default. see the bit about even the granting of rights by an author having to be explicitly specified  under french law. the fact that two ip lawyers in france think that the gpl is covered as a sale make me feel that there is a de facto sale and a de facto contract.  5) roughly. there may be other reasons under french law why the gpl may be invalid.  whole article.  freedom(a) is worth more than these imperfect licences. specialised lawyers look at the gpl. lawyer cyril rojinsky (duly appointed to the court) and the jurist vincent grynbaum, both specialised in the area of intellectual property examine the ""free"" licences and in particular the gpl. they have published their study in the review ""proprietes intellectuelles (intellectual property)1"" and their conclusion is grim. their approach is interesting. the problem for them is not to know whether freedom is valid under french law (for them the question is a moot point) but rather they asked themselves about the form and the content of the text of free licences, and in particular the gpl. the problem is not free programmes, but rather the licence contracts of free programmes. absence of critical clauses. the authors tell us that first of all, the reference to ""copyright"" is not legally sufficient in the framework of international contracts (which is the case of licence contracts for programmes developed and spread via the internet). the idea of copyright can basically include differences from one country to another. this is why, under international contracts, it is necessary to specify to which laws one is referring (french law, american c.). the authors only found three public licences which were correctly formulated on this point qpl, ibm public licence and the mozilla public licence). specification in the english language. next, the authors remind us that (at least in france), no clause in a contract may be contrary to french law 2. however, it turns out that a licence such as the gpl is contrary to french law in several respects. firstly, it is written in english and the fsf doesn't officially approve translations. the ""toubon law"" obliges this sort of contract to be written in french, including for businesses since the notion of ""user"" applies not only to consumers, but also to businesses, professionals c. contacted by the editors of linuxfrench, lawyer cyril rojinsky declared that, as far as business is concerned, the ""toubon law"" is probably doomed to change since it is in contradiction of european directives on the subject, but whatever about that, the problem is still valid for individuals, and while waiting for it (french law) to change, french companies have to deal with it, since it is the law of the land. a programme under the gpl can suddenly change licence. another problem, much more serious, is that according to french law, the author of a free programme can, at any time, invoke the invalidity of the licence for this software by simply changing the licence. in effect, the law of intellectual property stipulates that the granting of rights by the author is subordinate to the condition that each of these granted rights be the object of a distinct clause in the granting act (i.e. the licence) and that the granting of any such rights be delimited with respect to its scope and its grantees, and also with respect to its location (i.e. where such rights may be excersised) and duration of any such grants. 3 this is not the case of the gpl nor of other free licences. briefly, this means that in france, or elsewhere if the author is french, that which is under the gpl could revert to proprietary from one day to the next. the problem of the guarantee ""hidden defects"". an other very serious flaw is that of the guarantee. the gpl licences and others show that the software is delivered ""without guarantee"". you are going to immediately reply that commercical programmes carry the same clause in their licence contracts, and this is correct. however, whatever is written in a licence contract, one cannot free oneself from the ""guarantee from hidden defects"", since it is imposed in the civil code. this concept is poorly understood by the layman, it protects the buyer (whoever it may be, individual or business, since it specifies the civil code and not consumer protection law) against hidden defects, deliberate or made in good faith by the seller. for example, if one buys a pair of socks in a sale, and the shop has a notice specifying that ""sale items are neither refunded nor exchanged"", and on arriving home you notice that one of the socks has a hole in it, several scenarios are possible. you could have checked the socks before purchase the flaw is deemed ""obvious"" and you can sing for your money. you couldn't check the socks (they were packaged for example), and in this case, despite the notice ""neither refund nor exchange"", you may invoke ""hidden defect"" and have them changed or obtain a refund, it's up to you. personally, i have already invoked in shops the ""hidden defect"" clause and it always worked well (shopkeepers are always very cooperative if you quote a couple of words of the civil code). the concept of hidden defect is rather wide, it is necessary that you hadn't the possibility of discovering the defect before buying the product and then (according to the civil code) that you wouldn't have bought it at that price if you had known about the defect. the third case which is much rarer , is if you are able to show that the vendor had knowledge of the defect (hidden), but didn't inform you. in this case, not only does he have to reimburse the product, but all expenses incurred by the sale (metro tickets to go to the shop, the fuse which blew when you plugged it in c.) this idea of ""hidden defect"" applies to all products, including programmes. this was made abundantly clear by the authorities (and the courts) surrounding y2k. this is particularly inconvenient for free programmes, since a site which offers a linux distro for download is supposed to provide a guarantee against hidden flaws. linuxfrench asked cyril rojinsky if in the case of a free programme, one could speak about a ""hidden"" defect since the source code was available, he replied ""actually, concerning the guarantee, the question of obvious defect will arise. this analyis will be different depending on whether the person who downloads the distribution is an it professional or not"". opensource has this advantage over the proprietary programme it protects the distributor against a guarantee of hidden defect insofar as the buy is an it person. but, for distribution to the public at large, the problem remains the same. roughly speaking. lawyer cyril rojinsky said it himself, this study is far from being exhaustive and many other areas could be explored. during this interview, we asked ourselves, for example, about the fragility of the gpl clause which forbids linking source code under the gpl with proprietary code. in effect, the laws of intellectual property give the right to the user to modify a programme with the intention of permitting interoperability with another programme. if for that, i need to link with a proprietary library (communication protocol, device driver) i may consider as ""null and void"" this clause of the gpl. the conclusion of this study is a wake up call for the community. ""freedom"" merits more than these shoddy licences, which should be modified before court cases over them proliferate and put at risk the undeniable originality of this effort.  1 une publication de l'institut de recherche en proprit intellectuelle, no4 juillet 2002 2 une telle clause de contrat qui est oppose  ce que dit la loi franaise est qualifie en terme juridique de  clause rpute noncrite , c'estdire qu'on fait comme si cette clause n'tait pas crite dans le contrat. c'est pour cela par exemple que vous pouvez signer un bail pour un appartement qui stipule que les enfants sont interdits dans l'immeuble, et envisager sans inquitude d'avoir quand mme un enfant, en effet le code civil stipule que le devoir d'un locataire d'un appartement doit se comporter en  bon pre de famille  3 article l1313  do you yahoo!?  une adresse yahoo.fr gratuite et en franais ! yahoo! mail   irish linux users' group for (un)subscription information. list maintainer",[],11222,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(one popular mimecapable mailer for unix, vms and pcs is pine, developed at the university of washington and available via anonymous ftp from the host ftp.cac.washington.edu in the file pinepine.tar.z) in addition, several proprietary email systems provide mime translation capability in their internet gateway products. however, even if you do not have access to a mimecapable mailer or suitable gateway, there is still hope! there are a number of standalone programs that can interpret a mime message. one of the more versatile is called ""munpack"". it was developed at carnegie mellon university and is available via anonymous ftp from the host ftp.andrew.cmu.edu in the directory pubmpack. there are versions available for unix, pc, mac and amiga systems. for compabibility with older forms of transferring binary files, the munpack program can also decode messages in splituuencoded format. does mime replace uuencode? yes. uuencode has been used for some time for encoding binary files so that they can be sent via internet mail, but it has several technical limitations and interoperability problems. mime uses a more robust encoding called ""base64"" which has been carefully designed to survive the message transformations made by certain email gateways. how can i learn more about mime? the mime internet standard is described in rfc1521, available via anonymous ftp from many different internet hosts, including o us east coast address ds.internic.net (198.49.45.10) o us west coast address ftp.isi.edu (128.9.0.32) o pacific rim address munnari.oz.au (128.250.1.21) o europe address nic.nordu.net (192.36.148.17) look for the file rfcrfc1521.txt another source of information is the internet news group ""comp.mail.mime"", which includes a periodic posting of a ""frequently asked questions"" list.",[],3193,0,0,easy_ham_testing

2002 135715 0400 to digital bearer settlement list from ""r. a. hettinga"" subject california needs intelligent energy deregulation sender posted on tue, sep. 24, 2002 dan gillmor state needs intelligent energy deregulation by dan gillmor mercury news technology columnist the facts were trade and government secrets at the time. but the energy industry failed the smell test in 2000 and 2001 as it tried to justify soaring wholesale electricity and naturalgas prices in california. now, as investigators and regulators unravel the reasons for a financial and fiscal mess we'll be cleaning up for decades, we're learning what everyone suspected. market games helped engineer the price spikes. the latest manipulation was highlighted in monday's finding by a federal administrative law judge, who said a dominant naturalgas company squeezed supplies in order to squeeze customers. his ruling came a few days after california's public utilities commission reported that electricity generators mysteriously failed to use available capacity during the crunch, also driving up prices. and don't forget the sleazy games by energy traders who gleefully worked the system, in schemes best summed up by an enron insider's boast in a memorandum made public in may, that enron gets paid for moving energy to relieve congestion without actually moving any energy or relieving any congestion.'' how much of this was illegal, as opposed to simply amoral, remains to be seen. unfortunately, california's response  confusion, lawsuits and policy tweaks  hasn't been sufficient. more unfortunately, even if the state suddenly did all the right things  including a hardnosed program designed to free ourselves from the gougers' grips  we would need a willing federal partner. but it's foolish to think that the bush administration would do much to help one of its least favorite states, or do anything that conflicts with its love of traditional, nonrenewable energy sources. if the lawsuits against various energy companies and traders bear any fruit, the best we can expect is to pay off some of the massive debts the state amassed to prevent a total collapse in early 2001. that's a reasonable approach, but don't expect miracles. state policies are moving the wrong way on utility regulation, meanwhile. instead of relentlessly pursuing smart deregulation  still a good idea if it gives customers genuine choices  state laws and regulations put the utilities back in the business of buying energy for captive customers,'' notes v. john white, executive director of the sacramentobased center for energy efficiency and renewable technologies ( it's tempting to call for an outright state takeover of the utilities  tempting but a bad idea. when there's genuine competition, as we could achieve in electricity generation, the private sector tends to do a better job. instead of abandoning deregulation, california should find a way to inject real competition into the market. we do need to recognize that the current system of delivering electricity defies privatization, at least under current conditions. smart regulation is essential. but the best response to gouging is to use less of what the gougers control. there are two ways conservation and replacement. we need more of both. the best recent step is a new state law that slowly but surely ratchets up the use of electricity from renewables. by 2017, california's utilities will have to get 20 percent of their power from solar and other renewable sources. several power companies are expected to do this even sooner. but this law has an element of oldline thinking, the captivecustomer model we need to be getting away from, not sustaining. lip service to newer ideas isn't enough. the state should be removing barriers to microgeneration systems, small generators that can run on a variety of fuels and provide decentralized, hardertodisrupt electricity to homes and businesses. this technology is coming along fast. state policies are not keeping pace. investing to save energy is increasingly the smartest move of all. california should be doing more to encourage this, whether through tax incentives or outright grants in lowincome households. california hasn't done badly on conservation in a general sense, and energy customers did react to last year's soaring rates and blackouts by cutting back, but it's lunacy to wait for the next crisis when we can do something to avoid it altogether. maybe this is all pointless. the bush administration's energy policies, so grossly tilted toward the unholy trinity of oil, coal and nuclear, are making us all more vulnerable. never mind what might happen if the coming war in iraq goes badly. it's pointless to hope for a sane federal policy  a crash program to drastically speed the inevitable transition to a hydrogenbased energy system. but the largest state, one of the world's major economies in its own right, does have some clout. we can hit the ripoff artists where it hurts, and protect ourselves from even more serious disruptions. maybe next year.   r. a. hettinga mailto the internet bearer underwriting corporation  44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa

(to keep live query grated, google filters out sexrelated searches, though less successfully with foreign languages.) despite its geographic and ethnic diversity, the world is spending much of its time thinking about the same things. the same topic areas bubble to the top celebrities, current events, products and computer downloads. it's amazing how similar people are all over the world based on what they are searching for,'' said greg rae, one of three members of google's logs team, which is responsible for building, storing and protecting the data record. google's following  it is the most widely used search engine  has given mr rae a worldview from his cubicle. since october 2001, he has been able to reel off anthrax'' in several languages, including milzbrand in german and carbonchio in italian. he says he can also tell which countries took their recent elections seriously (brazil and germany), because of the frenzy of searches. he notes that the globalisation of consumer culture means that the most popular brands are farflung in origin nokia, sony, bmw, ferrari, ikea and microsoft. judging from google's data, some sports events stir interest almost everywhere the tour de france, wimbledon, the melbourne cup horse race and the world series were among the top 10 sportsrelated searches last year. it also becomes obvious just how familiar american movies, music and celebrities are to searchers across the globe. two years ago, a google engineer named lucas pereira noticed that searches for britney spears had declined, indicating what he thought must be a decline in her popularity. from that observation grew google zeitgeist, a listing of the top gaining and declining queries of each week and month. glancing over google zeitgeist is like taking a trivia test in cultural literacy ulrika jonsson, the swedishborn british television host and girlfriend of england football coach sven goran eriksson, made the list recently. so did irish travellers (a nomadic ethnic group, one of whose members was videotaped beating her young daughter in indiana) and fentanyl (the narcotic gas used in the moscow raid to rescue hostages taken by chechen rebels in late october). the longlasting volume of searches involving her name has made britney spears something of a benchmark for the logs team. it has helped them understand how news can cause spikes in searches, as it did when she broke up with justin timberlake. google can feel the reverberations of such events, and others of a more serious nature, immediately. on feb 28, 2001, for example, an earthquake began near seattle at 1054 am local time. within two minutes, earthquakerelated searches jumped to 250 a minute from almost none, with a concentration in the us pacific northwest. on sept 11, searches for the world trade center, pentagon and cnn shot up immediately after the attacks. over the next few days, nostradamus became the top search query, fuelled by a rumour that nostradamus had predicted the trade center's destruction. but the most trivial events may also register on google's sensitive cultural seismic meter. the logs team came to work one morning to find that carol brady maiden name'' had surged to the top of the charts. curious, they mapped the searches by time of day and found that they were neatly grouped in five spikes, each one starting at 48 minutes after the hour. as the logs were passed through the office, employees were perplexed. why would there be a surge in interest in a character from the 1970s sitcom the brady bunch? but the data could only reflect patterns, not explain them. that is a paradox of a google log it does not capture social phenomena per se, but merely the shadows they cast across the internet. the most interesting part is why,'' said amit patel, who has been a member of the logs team. you can't interpret it unless you know what else is going on in the world.'' so what had gone on on april 22, 2001? that night the milliondollar question on the game show who wants to be a millionaire? had been, what was carol brady's maiden name?'' seconds after the show's host posed the question, thousands flocked to google to search for the answer (tyler), producing four spikes as the show was broadcast successively in each us time zone. the precision of the carol brady data was eyeopening for some. it was like trying an electron microscope for the first time,'' said sergey brin, who as a graduate student in computer science at stanford helped found google in 1998 and is now its president for technology. it was like a momentbymoment barometer.'' predictably, google's query data respond to television, movies and radio. but the mass media also feed off the demands of their audiences. one of google's strengths is its predictive power, flagging trends before they hit the radar of other media. as such it could be of tremendous value to entertainment companies or retailers. google is quiet about what if any plans it has for commercialising its vast store of query information. there is tremendous opportunity with this data,'' mr silverstein said. the challenge is defining what we want to do.'' google currently does not allow outsiders to gain access to raw data because of privacy concerns. searches are logged by time of day, originating ip address (information that can be used to link searches to a specific computer), and the sites on which the user clicked. people tell things to search engines that they would never talk about publicly  viagra, pregnancy scares, fraud, facelifts. what is interesting in the aggregate can be seem an invasion of privacy if narrowed to an individual. in aggregate form, google's data can make a stunning presentation. next to mr rae's cubicle is the geodisplay, a 40inch screen that gives a threedimensional geographical representation of where google is being used around the globe. the searches are represented by coloured dots shooting into the atmosphere. the colours  red, yellow, orange  convey the impression of a globe whose major cities are on fire. the tallest flames are in new york, tokyo and the san francisco bay area. each country has a distinctive usage pattern. spain, france and italy have a midday lull in google searches, presumably reflecting leisurely lunches and relaxation. in japan, the peak usage is after midnight, when phone rates for dialup modems drop. google's worldwide scope means that the company can track ideas and phenomena as they hop from country to country. take las ketchup, a trio of singing sisters who became a sensation in spain last spring with a gibberish song and accompanying kneeknocking dance similar to the macarena. like a series of waves, google searches for las ketchup undulated through europe over the summer and fall. the ketchup song (hey hah) has already topped the charts in 18 countries. in late summer, google's logs show, las ketchup searches began a strong upward climb in the united states, britain and the netherlands. haven't heard of las ketchup?

""one of the reasons we were interested is few other folks were,"" said james coulter, a partner at texas pacific, in an interview after the bankruptcy filing. ""there aren't many people around with the stomach or the knowledge to delve into the airline industry."" texas pacific, which manages $8 billion, thrives by buying businesses no one else wants. mr. coulter and mr. bonderman made their names during the recession of the early 1990's with investments in continental and america west. the firm's hallmark is to take an active hand in shaping companies, sometimes ousting poor managers and tapping its extensive network of contacts for talented replacements. now the partners are again looking for trouble. in the last year alone, texas pacific has announced or completed six acquisitions, most in unloved industries like semiconductors, reinsurance and airlines. just last month, it announced plans to buy burger king, which has been losing market share, for $2.26 billion. it is also bidding for bankgesellschaft berlin, a large and troubled bank. the most creative, and potentially lucrative, of these deals could be texas pacific's acquisition last november of memc electronic materials, a semiconductor company, for $6  yes, just $6  in cash. it will also guarantee a $150 million bank loan. in the last few years, most firms that specialize in leveraged buyouts  the use of junk bonds, bank loans and other borrowings to buy or take big stakes in companies  have been largely inactive. falling stock prices have made managements reluctant to sell cheaply. companies that are for sale have tangled finances or face a cash squeeze. texas pacific is different. ""this is a terrific environment for them,"" said stephen schwarzman, chief executive of the blackstone group, which also specializes in buyouts. mark attanasio, a managing director at trust company of the west, which has invested with texas pacific, said ""most other buyout firms want to buy companies that are growing. you don't see many guys wanting to take on operational fixes."" like most other buyout firms, texas pacific tries to keep its inner workings private its partners rarely grant interviews and its web site is perpetually under construction. mr. bonderman, mr. coulter and william price, the third founding partner, declined to be interviewed for this article. mr. bonderman, 59, is known for his rumpled shirts and bright, patterned socks. ""he likes argyle socks, and they tend to fall down around his ankles,"" said henry miller, an investment banker who advises troubled companies. early in his career, when he was a washington lawyer, mr. bonderman argued a case in court wearing a brown velvet suit. when a texas pacific deal is being negotiated, he is known for obsessively staying in touch, even when he is trekking in places like pakistan, nepal and, most recently, bhutan. ""whenever i see a long, unfamiliar phone number pop up on my caller i.d., i know it's david calling,"" said one investment banker who often works with mr. bonderman. mr. bonderman made his reputation in the 1980's as the chief investment officer for robert bass, the texas oilman. mr. bonderman enriched mr. bass a second time by making early bets in industries like cable television and taking stakes in troubled companies like american savings  loan, which had been seized by the government. over nearly a decade, mr. bonderman's picks earned an average annual return of 63 percent for mr. bass. in 1993, mr. bonderman struck out on his own with mr. coulter, a former lehman brothers banker who had also worked for mr. bass. they teamed up later that year with mr. price, a veteran of ge capital capital and bain  company, a consulting firm, to form texas pacific. the three men have complementary skills, investment bankers and other deal makers said. mr. bonderman is the master strategist and mr. coulter is good at structuring deals and the detailed management of the firm's purchases. mr. price often recruits managers and advises on operational issues. ""david is very much the optimist, very much the deal maker,"" said greg brenneman, a former president of continental. ""jim is very much a counterbalance to david. he will sit back and ask the tough questions. he will approach investments a little bit more skeptically than david does."" by the end of the 1990's, texas pacific was well established in deal making. it easily raised $4.5 billion from pension funds and other investors in early 2000. to celebrate their war chest, the firm's partners rented san francisco's city hall and hired the b52's to play at a party. but as the stock market began to tumble, texas pacific hesitated. for a 17month stretch, the partners made no deals. they checked out some of the biggest corporate blowups, including adelphia, xerox and global crossing, but stayed away, finding the prices and the quality of the businesses untenable. instead, texas pacific began to hastily exit some existing investments, taking more than $2 billion in profits during that stretch. ""they started to cash out early in the cycle,"" said mario giannini, chief executive of hamilton lane, a money management firm, some of whose clients are texas pacific investors. the good times of the late 1990's were not ideal for texas pacific  it struggled to find downtrodden companies that needed its help. but texas pacific did manage to spot a few diamonds in the rough. it revived oxford health plans, the health maintenance organization that nearly collapsed in the mid1990's, almost doubling its money after bringing in new managers and upgrading computer systems. in 1996, it made a $280 million investment in ducati motor, the italian motorcycle maker, whose profits have since more than quadrupled. but texas pacific also stumbled, usually when it bought at the top of the market. texas pacific's $560 million investment in the j. crew group, the clothing retailer, for which it paid a steep price of 10 times cash flow in 1997, has been a disappointment. so has its 1999 purchase of bally, the shoe maker, which has suffered from lower demand for luxury goods. texas pacific also lost more than $100 million on zilog, a semiconductor company, and favorite brands, a candy maker, both of which filed for bankruptcy. some of these investments have taken a toll on the firm's performance. texas pacific is still selling off holdings in two investment funds it raised over the last decade. the first fund, a $720 million portfolio raised in 1993 and including investments made through march 1997, should return more than 40 percent, according to one texas pacific investor. but its second fund  $2.5 billion raised in 1997  could return less than half that, this investor estimated, since the firm had less time to take profits on these investments before the stock market sank. but because texas pacific has not sold many of its holdings in the second fund, profits on these investments could rebound. it is hoping, for example, that with new management in place, j. crew will turn around as the economy rebounds. in any case, one competitor said, ""their returns look pretty good when you consider that some other funds won't return any capital"" to investors. but with the weak economy throwing many companies into trouble, texas pacific seems poised to repeat its earlier success, the investor said. ""they should do exceptionally well,"" he said. texas pacific has a distinct style  if not formula. it relies on talented, selfsufficient managers to restructure troubled companies, preferring to remain handsoff, except for surveillance from the boardroom. when necessary, it replaces managers. less than a year after continental emerged from bankruptcy, for example, mr. bonderman watched with frustration as his old friend robert r. ferguson, the chief executive, led it to the edge of another trip to bankruptcy court. continental's board, where mr. bonderman was chairman, then brought in gordon m. bethune, an executive at boeing, and in october 1994 he replaced mr. ferguson as chief executive. mr. bethune quickly did a toptobottom overhaul of the company and is now considered a great turnaround artist of the industry. ""the biggest conflict i've ever seen was with bob ferguson,"" said clark onstad, a former general counsel for the federal aviation administration, in describing the thinking of mr. bonderman, whom he has known since the 1982 braniff bankruptcy. ""he chose bethune over his longtime friend ferguson because he thought bethune would do a better job."" at america west, texas pacific initiated an even more extensive management overhaul. this time, the charge was led by mr. coulter and mr. schifter, both directors. w. douglas parker, the current chief executive, flew to mr. coulter's home in san francisco to interview for the job of chief financial officer. they talked for hours, and mr. parker said the two men quickly realized they had ""somewhat kindred spirits."" the board replaced most senior managers at america west, except william franke, the chief executive, who stepped down last september. his restructuring plan had made the airline profitable a year and a half before it emerged from bankruptcy in august 1994. texas pacific owns just 3 percent of america west, worth about $33.7 million. but those are controlling shares, and the group holds more than 50 percent of the votes. ""these are not passive investors, nor am i,"" said donald l. sturm, a denver businessman who serves on continental's board with mr. bonderman and mr. price. ""you're active. your money is at stake. your reputation is at stake."" after overseeing managers who worked successfully with unions at continental and america west, texas pacific has a good reputation with labor. that was one reason us airways was interested in a texas pacific investment, said chris chiames, a spokesman for the airline. mr. siegel wanted an investor who would ""be as labor friendly as possible,"" mr. chiames said. but us airways can still entertain other bids this fall, and marvin davis, the billionaire investor from los angeles, has expressed interest. texas pacific's investment in burger king, made with goldman, sachs and bain capital, was announced after two years of discussions among texas pacific's partners and the chain's franchisees  even before the company, which had been owned by diageo, the liquor company, was put up for sale, said julian josephson, chairman of the national franchisee association, which represents most burger king franchisees. ""we liked what they had to say about the human component of the businesses they buy,"" mr. josephson said. many other owners, he added, ""are dismissive of labor."" at burger king, texas pacific will also be working with an executive it knows. burger king's chief executive is john dasburg, the former chief executive of northwest airlines, who met mr. bonderman and his partners when northwest bought out their stake in continental in 1998. unlike most buyout firms, texas pacific remains enamored with the technology industry, despite the failure of so many startups the last two years. it has focused on the semiconductor industry, which like the airline industry is highly cyclical. so far, though, results have been mixed. the firm's 1996 acquisition of the paradyne corporation, which makes equipment for highspeed internet connections, has been a huge success. texas pacific split it in two and took both parts public in the late 1990's, selling most of its stakes for 23 times its investment. but a much larger investment, its $400 million acquisition of zilog, the chip maker, in 1998, was made just before the economic crisis in asia caused chip prices to plummet. zilog filed for bankruptcy last year. texas pacific is still hoping for a turnaround at a third company, on semiconductor, which it acquired for $1.6 billion three years ago. it invested $100 million more last year. its latest gamble on the industry, the $6 deal for memc, may prove the most lucrative. the cost of mailing the payment to e.on, based in dsseldorf, germany, was actually more than the acquisition, one executive close to the deal said. texas pacific, and its partners in the deal, trust company of the west and leonard green  partners, agreed to guarantee a $150 million revolving line of credit. texas pacific also assumed $900 million worth of debt, most of which it swapped for more stock in the company. ""they did a good job of timing the acquisition,"" said nabeel gareeb, the company's chief executive, who noted that in the last quarter memc reported its first profit since the fourth quarter of 2000. but texas pacific's interest in airlines is clearly sizable. besides its involvement in continental, america west and us airways, the company plans to buy gate gourmet, the catering business of the bankrupt swissair group. two years ago, texas pacific started a webbased discount ticket service called hotwire. it put up most of the $75 million in seed money, then persuaded six airlines to invest with it, said karl peterson, the chief executive. hotwire, instead of asking consumers to bid on tickets, as priceline does, shows the cheapest ticket on its web site but does not reveal the exact flight and travel time until after the sale. the contraction of the new economy has undoubtedly hurt hotwire, which is privately owned. mr. peterson said that the company was still unprofitable but that texas pacific remains committed to it. last spring, mr. peterson met mr. bonderman in aspen to talk about hotwire and to go snowboarding. mr. bonderman seemed perfectly willing to accompany hotwire down the steep internet chute. but he does have his limits on risk, mr. peterson discovered. before going down the mountain, mr. bonderman strapped on a helmet.  how to advertise  for information on advertising in email newsletters or other creative advertising opportunities with the new york times on the web, please contact or visit our online media kit at for general information about nytimes.com, write to copyright 2002 the new york times company",[],16468,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(we hope this isn't a difficult question, as the panel's been given all of one day to report back.) when bush gets the report on tuesday, the next step might be a court order to reopen the ports under the 1947 tafthartley act. that would send employees back to work for 80 days while federal mediators duke it out over the disputed contract and retailers lower their xanax dosages. invoking tafthartley requires a threat to national health or safety  not the economy. but labor secretary elaine chao covered that base in a statement on monday, saying the work stoppage threatens the flow of supplies to the military (we knew iraq would be in here somewhere). ""union officials quickly responded that their members have been unloading military cargo throughout the 10day shutdown,"" said the l.a. times, but an anonymous bush administration official ""said that only a portion of what the defense department needs has made it ashore."" politically, this has been a tricky one. using tafthartley would annoy labor right before congressional elections. on the other hand, ""voter discontent with bush's handling of the increasingly fragile economic recovery has begun showing up in polls, and such concerns may have outweighed the political danger to the republican administration,"" said the san francisco chronicle. also, bush stepped in on the same day that a poll reported twothirds of americans wanted him to focus more on the economy. ""though the administration promised an unbiased examination of the lockout, bush appeared to have made up his mind that it was hurting national security and the economy, andmerited federal intervention,"" said the ap. as for tafthartley, it's not exactly famous for solving labor disputes. often the 80day coolingoff period ends, and workers simply walk out again (or get locked out again, in this case). one gets the sense, however, that fixing the dockworkers' contract isn't the point of this particular 80 days. it's 78 days until christmas. the race is on.  jen muehlbauer president acts to halt port lockout for 80 days (seattle times) bush expected to act on ports crisis president moves toward forcing the reopening of west coast ports bush takes step toward halting lockout after west coast port talks break off (ap) white house intervenes on docks dispute (financial times) coolingoff period likely in port fight (sf chronicle) bush moves toward halting port shutdown trouble on the docks (paid subscription required.) charges of politics have dogged tafthartley act tafthartley act no quickfix for port dispute (reuters)  advertisement  special offer! save 24% on a subscription to mit technology review. get an inside view into the technologies, deals, and companies emerging from one of the leading research institutes  mit.  the biggest cable hookup  wo birds want to join forces and the fcc is about to cry ""fowl."" we mean ""foul."" the two dominant direct broadcast satellite players want to join forces, the better to compete with big cable. federal regulators, both the fcc and the justice department, are concerned that the resulting conglomerate of directv with dish network would command roughly 95% of satellite service in the us. the press could not settle on a price tag for the proposed merger between echostar communications and hughes electronics  it was described as being worth anywhere from $15 billion and $25 billion. it was a challenge to keep the players straight, as some outlets talked of a merger between the corporate parents, and others referred to the service monikers. hughes is directv and echostar is dish. all straight? the two companies sent a letter to the fcc urging them to hold off ruling on (read, rejecting) the merger until the justice department has spoken. echostar and hughes offered unspecified ""major revisions"" to the deal that they want to discuss with justice in the next weeks. the wall street journal delved deeply into the form those revisions could take  specifically, selling some frequencies to cablevision. the journal reported that cablevision has wanted to get into the satellite business for 10 years and outlined the cable company's plans and past spending on such a project. thestreet.com turned in an extensive analysis of the deal for investors in the satellite space. it seems the market for expandedservice television may be nearing saturation. thestreet.com quoted an analyst's report which concluded, ""consumers should benefit from ... continued rivalry, but shareholders may realize much smaller returns."" the new york times and the journal both mentioned rupert murdoch waiting in the wings. last year murdoch's news corp. bid for directv, but lost out at the last minute to echostar. if the current deal falls through, he'll be back.  keith dawson echostar and hughes propose concessions in bid to save deal (paid subscription required) regulators set to block echostar's hughes purchase (paid subscription required) 'lastditch effort' (rocky mountain news) echostar, hughes see a glimmer of hope f.c.c. asked to put off merger ruling echostar, hughes ask fcc to defer decision echostar, hughes offer merger changes (reuters) delay in satellitetv merger ok requested (ap) echostar, hughes seek to delay ruling echostar pleads to fcc on merger (denver post)  other stories  sec probes aoloxygen pact for doublebooking of revenue (paid subscription required.) tivo raises $25 million in stock offering (ap) worldcom officer pleads guilty to fraud two magazines are shut and a third revamps regulators say they have csfb 'smoking gun' expected cold winter could increase natural gas prices frozen world found beyond pluto fool me once new northwest system for internet bookings the fastestgrowing tech companies debating the baby bells (paid subscription required) silicon valley is yearning for userfriendly microsoft (paid subscription required)   do you want to reach the net's savviest audience?

""this project shows how a relatively simple speechtospeech translation system can be rapidly and successfully constructed using today's tools,"" said the team from carnegie mellon university in a research paper published recently. the research was commissioned by the us army, which is increasingly finding itself in peacekeeping roles where communication is key. speaking in tongues ""in the balkans, the army is not just supposed to conquer somebody,"" robert frederking of carnegie mellon university told the bbc programme go digital. translators could be essential for us soldiers ""in a peacekeeping situation, you have two guys trying to beat each other up and you are holding them apart. ""you can't just shot one of them, you have to figure what is going on and talk to them,"" he said. the portable translator was developed with a year, using commercially available laptops. the army did not want to fieldtest the device in a battlefield situation. so instead the translator was tested by us army chaplains in croatia. ""the chaplains very often end up having to talk to foreign nationals and typically don't have any translation support,"" explained mr frederking. slow system for the trials, the chaplains used the translator to speak to croatians who knew just a smattering of english. the system works by having a speech recogniser that picks up the words in croatian, turns the speech into text. the written words are then translated into english and read out by a speech synthesizer. ""it went reasonably well half the time,"" said mr frederking, though it was slow in translating phrases. the research team admit that the system is not ready to be deployed in the field. but they say their trials showed that a portable translator could be made to work with further research and development. the audio voice translation guide system project was a joint venture between the us army, the military manufacturer lockheed martin and carnegie mellon university.  yahoo! groups sponsor  receive phone calls and faxes while you're online! emerson switchboard eliminates the need for a second phone line. order the switchboard today for $39.95  shipping and handling.  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to your use of yahoo! groups is subject to",[],2892,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""our vision is to build out an xmlaware infrastructure,"" kelly said.  ""the xa35 is the first of a family.""   kelly explained that converting data into xml increases the  file size up  to 20 times. this, he said, makes processing the data very taxing on  application servers datapower believes an inline device is the best  alternative.   in addition to the large file sizes, security is also of paramount  importance in the world of xml.   ""today's firewalls are designed to inspect http traffic only,"" kelly  said. ""a soap packet with xml will go straight through a firewall.  firewalls are blind to xml today.""   future products in datapowers family will focus more specifically on  security, especially as web services proliferate, kelly said.   according to datapower, most existing solutions to offload xml  processing are homegrown and done in software  an approach  the company  itself tried initially and found to be inadequate with  regards to speed  and security. after trying the software path, the company turned to  creating a solution that would process xml in hardware.   ""our xg3 execution core converts xml to machine code,"" said kelly,  adding that to his knowledge no other company's solution does. kelly  said in the next few months he expects the market to be flooded with  technologies that claim to do xml processing  claims that  he believes  will be mostly false.  other contentaware switches, such as ssl (secure socket layer)  accelerators and load balancers, look at the first 64 bytes  of a packet,  while the xa35 provides deeper packet inspection, looking at  1,400 bytes  and thus enabling greater processing of xml data, kelly explained.   the 1uhigh network device has been tested against a large  collection of  xml and xsl data types and can learn new flavors of the  markup language  as they pass through the device.   the xa35 can be deployed in proxy mode behind a firewall and a load  balancer, and it will inspect all traffic that passes and  will identify  and process those packets that are xml, kelly said.   in addition to proxy mode, the device can also be used as an  application  coprocessor. this deployment method gives administrators  more granular  control over what data is inspected and the application server itself  controls the device.   datapower is not the only company chasing this emerging  market. startup  sarvega, based in burr ridge, ill., introduced the sarvega  xpe switch in  may, and earlier this month tarari, an intel spinoff,  launched with a  focus on content processing and acceleration.  the datapower device is now available, priced starting at  $54,995. the  company has announced one customer to date and says the product is in  field trails at a number of other enterprises.        datapower has been addressing enterprise networking needs  since it was  founded in early 1999 by eugene kuznetsov, a technology visionary who  foresaw the adverse effects xml and other next generation protocols  would have on enterprise networks. long before industry  interest in xml  grew, kuznetsov assembled a team of worldclass m.i.t. engineers and  designed the industry's first solutions to address the unique  requirements for processing xml. the first such solution was  a software  interpreter called dgxt. this softwarebased approach to xml  processing  is still licensed by many companies for use in their own  products today.   leveraging the detailed knowledge and customer experience gained from  developing softwarebased accelerators, kuznetsov's team  raised the bar  and designed a system for processing xml in purposebuilt  hardware. in  2001, datapower's effort produced xml generation three (xg3tm), the  industry's fastest technology for xml processing, bar none.   today, xg3tm technology powers the industry's first wirespeed xml  network devices, enabling secure, highspeed applications and xml web  services. while other companies are just now marketing first  versions of  products, datapower is delivering its third generation of technology,  providing an immediate return on technology investments to  industryleading customers and partners.   datapower's m.i.t. heritage is complemented by a management team that  brings decades of experience in the networking and computing  industries,  drawing veteran leaders from several successful companies including  akamai, argon, cascade, castle networks, sycamore and wellfleet.        datapower technology secures $9.5 million in funding   venrock associates, mobius venture capital and seed capital  back pioneer  in xmlaware networking for web services   cambridge, mass.  july 8, 2002  datapower technology, inc., the  leading provider of xmlaware network infrastructure, today announced  that it has secured $9.5 million in series b financing. investors for  this round include venrock associates, mobius venture capital  and seed  capital partners. michael tyrrell, of venrock, bill burnham,  of mobius,  and jeff fagnan, of seed capital, have joined datapowers board of  directors.   datapower will use this funding to accelerate development,  marketing and  sales of the companys breakthrough technology for xmlaware  networking.  founded in 1999, datapower invented the worlds first intelligent xml  networking devices, capable of transforming xml traffic and  transactions  at the wirespeed enterprises need to effectively embrace web  services  and other xmlcentric initiatives. datapowers solutions are based on  its patentpending xml generation three (xg3tm) technology.   ""enterprises are adopting xml at rapid rate to facilitate interand  intracompany communications but their network infrastructure is ill  prepared to support the requirements of this new traffic type.  datapowers xmlacceleration devices enable the wirespeed  processing of  xml that is required to support next generation enterprise  applications,"" said eugene kuznetsov, cto and founder of datapower  technology.   ""datapower gives companies the ability to use xml thats  critical to web  services projects without sacrificing an ounce of  performance."" a single  datapower acceleration engine delivers the processing power of 10  serversbreaking the performance bottleneck associated with xml  processing and delivering an extraordinary return on investment. in  addition, the datapower platform provides enhanced xml security,  protection against xmlbased denialofservice attacks, connection of  ebusiness protocols for incompatible xml data streams, load  balancing  between backend servers and realtime statistics reports.   ""in the postbubble economy, technology investment decisions require  laserfocused scrutiny. datapowers patentpending technology  addresses  a very real and growing pain point for enterprises,"" said michael  tyrrell of venrock associates. ""by turbocharging their networks with  datapowers unique xmlaware networking technology, companies will be  free to adopt next generation web services without encountering  performance and security pitfalls.""   ""we looked long and hard for a company capable of addressing  the rapidly  growing problems surrounding xml message processing performance and  security,"" said bill burnham of mobius venture capital.  ""datapower is on  their third generation of technology. their patent pending xml  generation three (xg3) technology was quite simply the single most  compelling technology solution we have seen to date.""   ""xml is not a nicetohave, it is a must have for enterprises serious  about optimizing application efficiency. since 1999,  datapower has been  developing solutions to facilitate enterprise use of xml and web  services,"" said jeff fagnan of seed capital partners. ""datapowers  xmlacceleration devices are a key requirement for  enterprises that rely  on xml for mission critical applications.""   about venrock associates  venrock associates was founded as the

(2) the risks of a compromise to the client (far more likely). this  would probably be by a malformed or extremely long string in the key  value, which would presumably lead to either dos or system compromise by  buffer overflow on the client system. and if the client writes the key back onto the server, yes, there's wide open for something nasty here. two other things spring to mind 1) if anyone can modify the key, how do you make sure that two users are not overwriting the same key, thereby causing undesirable effects. 2) if anyone have permissions to write to the key (and below), anyone can create thousands of extra keys under this key, thereby filling up the registry. the result of such a thing is obvious. if i got this all wrong, i'd be happy that you clarify a bit more and tell me where i might have misunderstood. med venlig hilsen  best regards, allan jensen si hoc signum legere potes, operis boni in rebus latinus alacribus et fructuosis potiri potes!",[],2518,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""promiscuity"" is thus inherently a description of distributions rather than averages. consider a population of 3 males and 3 females. let there be three pairings which result in each person having sex once. then, let one of the males also have sex with the other two females. sure, the average number of sex acts and sex partners is equal between the sexes, tautologically. but here more women than men are  above the single partner threshold  above the overall average 1.67 actspartners threshold  above the overall median 1.5 actspartners  above the overall mode 1 actspartners and here women have a higher mode (2) and median (2) number of partners. so in this contrived population, females are more ""promiscuous"" than males, unless ""promiscuity"" is defined uselessly.  gordon",[],1266,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(fwd),"hi kragen, this is an interesting analysis. i think that there are a couple of nits i might pick (for example, i don't expect that the market will be well developed with highest bidders for while), i think that the most important issue, which is that end users won't be able to fix their systems, is almost passed over. i know that you know this, and you allude to it, but your essay is getting passed around, so you might want to add to it bits about the sysadmin and others. there's one other point which you don't make, which i think is very important, which is that research into defining and addressing classes of vulnerabilities can't happen without libraries of available vulnerability code. i can think of three researchers into automated methods for addressing vulnerabilities who griped, uninvited, about the quality of the existing vulnerability sites. doing research into a set requires that you have enough examples, in the open, that you can define a set, and that the set is added to from time to time so you can make and test predictions. i feel fairly confident in saying that without full disclosure, we wouldn't have stackguard, its4, nissus, or snort. and the security admin's job would be a lot harder. adam on thu, aug 22, 2002 at 084212am 0200, eugen leitl wrote     eugen leitl a href""    icbmto n48 04'14.8'' e11 36'41.2''  83e5ca02 ede4

its hazards   on august 7th, an entity known as ""idefense"" sent out an announcement,  which is appended to this email. briefly, ""idefense"", which bills  itself as ""a global security intelligence company"", is offering cash  for information about security vulnerabilities in computer software  that are not publicly known, especially if you promise not to tell  anyone else.   if this kind of secret traffic is allowed to continue, it will pose a  very serious threat to our computer communications infrastructure.   at the moment, the dominant paradigm for computer security research  known as ""full disclosure"" people who discover security  vulnerabilities in software tell the vendor about them, and a short  while later  after the vendor has had a chance to fix the problem   they publish the information, including code to exploit the  vulnerability, if possible.   this method has proven far superior to the old paradigm established by  cert in the late 1980s, which its proponents might call ""responsible  disclosure""  never release working exploit code, and never release  any information on the vulnerability before all vendors have released  a patch. this procedure often left hundreds of thousands of computers  vulnerable to known bugs for months or years while the vendors worked  on features, and often, even after the patches were released, people  wouldn't apply them because they didn't know how serious the problem  was.   the underground computer criminal community would often discover and  exploit these same holes for months or years while the ""responsible  disclosure"" process kept their victims, who had no connections in the  underground, vulnerable.   the problem with this is that vulnerabilities that are widely known  are much less dangerous, because their victims can take steps to  reduce their potential impact  including disabling software,  turning off vulnerable features, filtering traffic in transit, and  detecting and responding to intrusions. they are therefore much less  useful to wouldbe intruders. also, software companies usually see  security vulnerabilities in their software as pr problems, and so  prefer to delay publication (and the expense of fixing the bugs) as  long as possible.   idefense is offering a new alternative that appears far more dangerous  than either of the two previous paradigms. they want to be a buyer in  a marketplace for secret software vulnerability information, rewarding  discoverers of vulnerabilities with cash.   not long before, snosoft, a group of security researchers evidently  including some criminal elements, apparently made an offer to sell the  secrecy of some software vulnerability information to the software  vendor specifically, they apparently made a private offer to  hewlettpackard to keep a vulnerability in hp's tru64 unix secret if  hp retained snosoft's ""consulting services"". hp considered this  extortion and responded with legal threats, and snosoft published the  information.   if this is allowed to happen, it will cause two problems which,  together, add up to a catastrophe.   first, secret software vulnerability information will be available to  the highest bidder, and to nobody else. for reasons explained later,  i think the highest bidders will generally be organized crime  syndicates, although that will not be obvious to the sellers.   second, finding software vulnerabilities and keeping them secret will  become lucrative for many more talented people. the result will be   just as in the ""responsible disclosure"" days  that the good  guys will remain vulnerable for months and years, while the majority  of current vulnerabilities are kept secret.   i've heard it argued that the highest bidders will generally be the  vendors of the vulnerable software, but i don't think that's  plausible. if someone can steal $20 000 because a software bug lets  them, the software vendor is never held liable often, in fact, the  people who administer the software aren't liable, either  when  credit card data are stolen from an ecommerce site, for example.  knowing about a vulnerability before anyone else might save a website  administrator some time, and it might save the software vendor some  negative pr, but it can net the thief thousands of dollars.   i think the highest bidders will be those for whom early vulnerability  information is most lucrative  the thieves who can use it to  execute the largest heists without getting caught. inevitably, that  means organized crime syndicates, although the particular gangs who  are good at networked theft may not yet exist.   there might be the occasional case where a market leader, such as  microsoft, could make more money by giving their competitors bad pr  than a gang could make by theft. think of a remoteroot hole in  samba, for example.   right now, people who know how to find security exploits are either  motivated by personal interest in the subject, motivated by the public  interest, motivated by a desire for individual recognition, or  personally know criminals that benefit from their exploits. creating  a marketplace in secret vulnerability information would vastly  increase the availability of that information to the people who can  afford to pay the most for it spies, terrorists, and organized crime.   let's not let that happen.      this is the original idefense announcement   from sunil james  sent wednesday, august 07, 2002 1232 pm  subject introducing idefense's vulnerability contributor program    greetings,   idefense is pleased to announce the official launch of its vulnerability  contributor program (vcp). the vcp pays contributors for the advance  notification of vulnerabilities, exploit code and malicious code.   idefense hopes you might consider contributing to the vcp. the following  provides answers to some basic questions about the program   q. how will it work?  a. idefense understands the majority of security researchers do not publish  security research for compensation rather, it could be for any of a number  of motivations, including the following    pure love of security research   the desire to protect against harm to targeted networks   the desire to urge vendors to fix their products   the publicity that often accompanies disclosure   the vcp is for those who want to have their research made public to the  internet community, but who would also like to be paid for doing the  work.the compensation will depend, among other things, on the following  items    the kind of information being shared (i.e. vulnerability or exploit)   the amount of detail and analysis provided   the potential severity level for the information shared   the types of applications, operating systems, and other  software and hardware potentially affected   verification by idefense labs   the level of exclusivity, if any, for data granted to idefense   q. who should contribute to the vcp?  a. the vcp is open to any individual, security research group or other  entity.   q. why are you launching this program?  a. timeliness remains a key aspect in security intelligence. contributions  to some lists take time before publication to the public at large. more  often, many of these services charge clients for access without paying the  original contributor. under the idefense program, the contributor is  compensated, idefense labs verifies the issue, and idefense clients and the  public at large are warned in a timely manner.   q. who gets the credit?  a. the contributor is always credited for discovering the vulnerability or  exploit information.   q. when can i contribute?  the vcp is active. you are welcome to begin contributing today.   to learn more, go to if you have  questions or would like to sign up as a contributor to the vcp, please  contact us at   regards,   sunil james  technical analyst  idefense   ""idefense is a global security

""this is probably the most serious new garden pest in recent memory,"" said max barclay, the curator of beetles at the natural history museum in london who discovered the creatures in the uk. the black vine weevil has long been native to britain, causing enormous damage to glossy leaved plants such as laurels. but the two new species, otiorhynchus armadillo and otiorhynchus salicicola, not previously known north of switzerland, are now prevalent in south london. ""it's very likely these weevils have been introduced to britain through imported ornamental plants from italy,"" said dr barclay. ""it looks like they're here to stay."" he found otiorhynchus armadillo on the window of a chelsea department store in 1998, but as the shop sold imported house plants, he assumed it was a migrant. it has now quietly become the most common species of vine weevil in southwest london. the second invader is not so numerous, but has established itself firmly in the same area. apart from laurels, vine weevils attack bay, viburnum, ornamental ivy, and grape vines. an early sign of trouble is that notches appear in leaves. the soildwelling larvae bite the roots off below the surface. one possible explanation for the invaders' successful colonisation of britain is global warming. earlier springs and milder winters are already a fact.  yahoo! groups sponsor  sell a home with ease!  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to your use of yahoo! groups is subject to",[],2303,0,0,easy_ham_testing

10:56:41-07:00,ejw@cse.ucsc.edu,fork@spamassassin.taint.org,RE: CO2 and climate (was RE: Goodbye Global Warming),re co2 and climate (was re goodbye global warming),"ok, let's bring some data into the discussion (a graph, derived from vostok ice core samples, of co2 and temperature fluctuations over the past 400k years).  recent highresolution studies of historical co2 concentrations and  temperatures over hundreds of thousands of years have shown a modest  correlation between the two. in a number of cases, co2 level increases  are not in phase with temperature increases and actually trail the  increase in temperature by a short time i.e. increases in temperature  preceded increases in co2 concentrations. the more studies that are done  of the geological record, the more it seems that co2 concentrations are  correlated with temperature increases, but are not significantly  causative. based on the vostok data, you are right, there is a very strong correlation between temperature and co2 concentrations, but it doesn't always appear to be causal.  with respect to absolute co2 concentrations, it is also important to  point out that our best data to date suggests that they follow a fairly  regular cycle with a period of about 100,000 years. also correct  the peak of each cycle is at about 290300 ppm co2.  as it  happens, current co2 concentrations are within 10% of other previous  cyclical concentration peaks for which we have good data. not correct. mauna loa data  and  show that the current co2 concentrations are at 370ppm, 18% greater than the highest recorded value from the past 400k years. furthermore, co2 concentrations are growing at 15ppm every 10 years, much faster than any recorded increase in the vostok data (though perhaps the vostok data isn't capable of such fine resolution).  in other words, we may be adding to the co2 levels, no, we are definitely adding to co2 levels. look at the following chart (shows co2 concentrations since 1870, the ""historical record""). not only is the co2 increase over 130 years unprecedented in the vostok record, it is clear that the rate of change is increasing, not decreasing. there is no other compelling explanation for this increase, except for anthropogenic input. you're really out on the fringe if you're debating this  even global warming skeptics generally concede this point.  but it looks a lot like we  would be building a molehill on top of a mountain in the historical  record. at the very least, there is nothing anomalous about current co2  concentrations. wrong again. current co2 levels are currently unprecedented over the past 400k years, unless there is some mechanism that allows co2 levels to quickly spike, and then return back to ""normal"" background levels (and hence the spike might not show up in the ice cores). still, by around 20752100 we will have reached 500 ppm co2, a level that even you would have a hard time arguing away.  also, co2 levels interact with the biosphere in a manner that ultimately  affects temperature. again, the interaction is not entirely  predictable, but this is believed to be one of the regulating negative  feedback systems mentioned above. yes, clouds and oceans are a big unknown. still, we know ocean water has a finite capacity to store co2, and if the world temperature doesn't increase, but we all have seattlelike weather all the time, the effects would be enormous.  last, as greenhouse gases go, co2 isn't particularly potent, although it  makes up for it in volume in some cases. gases such as water and  methane have a far greater impact as greenhouse gases on a per molecule  basis. water vapor may actually be the key greenhouse gas, something  that co2 only indirectly effects through its interaction with the  biosphere. correct. data on relative contributions of greenhouse gasses note that methane concentrations now are much higher than preindustrial levels (many cows farting, and rice paddies outgassing), and methane is also a contributor in the formation of atmospheric water vapor. another clearly anthropogenic increase in a greenhouse gas. i'm in favor of reductions in methane levels as well. data on water vapor here  co2 was an easy mark for early environmentalism, but all the recent  studies and data i've seen gives me the impression that it is largely a  passenger on the climate ride rather than the driver. i tend to think that holistic, and techical approaches would work best in reducing global warming. i favor an energy policy that has a mix of solar, wind and nuclear, with all carbonbased combustion using renewable sources of ch bonds. aggressive pursuit of carbon sink strategies also makes sense (burying trees deep underground, for example). approaches that involve reductions in lifestyle to a ""sustainable"" level are unrealistic  americans just won't do it (you'd be surprised at the number of climate change researchers driving suvs). but, as california showed

(the release version is generally out of date cvs access is recommended. you get the idea.) meanwhile, rdfxml production tools are so inconsistent that even rdf experts recommend not using rdf tools to produce an rss 1.0 feed if you want it to actually be read by any major rss aggregator. despite the twoyearold promise of better tools2, it is now the year 2002, and i built my rss 1.0 feed8212in the most sophisticated personal publishing system in the world8212by manually typing a mishmash of template tags and angle brackets into a textarea of an html form.  extensible through namespaces, which, as mentioned above, have been haphazardly and poorly incorporated into rss 2.0, where they appear to be flourishing. evolvable formats8212those that proceed by being adapted and extended in a thousand small ways8212have three main characteristics that are germane to their eventual victories over strong, centrally designed formats.  only solutions that produce partial results with imperfect tools can succeed. my rss feed is an xml document produced by a template that i built in a textarea, and consumed by hundreds of parsers around the world that know nothing of xml and hack apart my feed with regular expressions. the world is littered with formats that would have worked if only everyone had better tools. if everyone in the world had a perfect rdf parser at their disposal, it would be trivial to produce and consume all the world's metadata in rdf. without such perfect tools, both production and consumption instantly become nightmares. there is no middle ground.  what is, is wrong. because evolvable formats have always been adapted to earlier conditions and are always being further adapted to present conditions, they are always behind the times. rss was being stretched with long descriptions, optional titles, and entityencoded html even before such practices were codified in the spec, and long before all consumers could handle them. no evolving format is ever perfectly in sync with the challenges it faces.  finally, orgel's rule, named for the evolutionary biologist leslie orgel82128220evolution is cleverer than you are8221. as with the list of rss's obvious deficiencies above, it is easy to point out what is wrong with any evolvable system at any point in its life. no one seeing rss 1.0 and rss 0.91 sidebyside could doubt that rss 1.0 had the superior technology, that it 8220did things right8221. however, the ability to understand what is missing at any given moment does not mean that one person or a small central group can design a better system in the long haul. designed formats start out strong and improve logarithmically. evolvable formats start out weak and improve exponentially. rss 2.0 is not the perfect syndication format, just the best one that's also currently practical. infrastructure built on evolvable formats will always be partially incomplete, partially wrong and ultimately better designed than its competition. 1 2",[],7617,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""why make setup reversable? instead you should collect all the information from the user and make all the changes in one batch at the end."" there are a couple of things to understand here. first of all, even if you do everything in one batch at the end, there's always a possibility that some step in the middle of the batch will fail, and in that case, a wellbehaved setup program will back out the steps that were already done. there are well over 100 error messages in the string table for fogbugz setup so the number of things that can fail is not insignificant. second, it's not nice to tell people about an error in their input three pages after they made the mistake. for example, early in the fogbugz setup process we prompt you to create an account for fogbugz to use img (fogbugz setup screenshot) the account creation could fail for a myriad of reasons, none of which can be predicted before trying to create the account. for example, the password might not conform to the system password policy. and different national versions of windows nt have different rules about accented letters in passwords (betcha didn't know that!). it's better to tell the user about this problem right away so they can correct their input rather than having a message come up during the long install process later, forcing the user to back up and fix it. and even if you force the user to back up and fix it, you still have to undo the first part of the work that you did before creating the account, otherwise you've left their system in an indeterminate state. in any case i need to write code to create the account and delete the account in case something later fails i might as well call that code on this page of the wizard where i can display a useful error message. and what are the kinds of things that need to be reversable? well, in order to upgrade fogbugz without requiring a reboot (and we never, ever require a reboot), we have to shut down a couple of processes that might have been keeping fogbugz files pinned down, such as iis (microsoft's web server). so part one of the batch is ""stop iis."" now if part 2 fails for some reason, it would be extremely rude to leave iis not running. and anyway, it's not like i don't need to write the code for ""start iis"" for the end of the batch. so the code to rollback ""stop iis"" is already written. no big deal, i just need to call it at the right place. i think one reason that people think you should ""gather all the info and then do all the work"" is because with very large installation programs that are very slow, this is a polite way to waste less of the user's time. indeed even fogbugz setup does 95% of its work at the very end. but the ""create account"" operation is so fast, that principle simply doesn't apply here. even our 95% of the work phase takes well under a minute, most of which is spent waiting for iis to stop and start. ""why did you use vcmfc? surely an advanced intelligence such as yourself has admitted by now that delphi3 is more productive."" first of all, leave your language religious fanaticism at the usenet door. somehow i managed to figure out in high school that language advocacy and religious arguments are unbelievably boring. secondly, even if delphi were more productive, the only pertinent question, since i am writing the code, is what is more productive for joel spolsky. and i don't know delphi at all, but i know win32, mfc, and vc really, really well. so while i might not outcode a good delphi programmer, i would definitely outcode a completely inexperienced delphi programmer (which is me), certainly over a short 4 week project. third, many of the things i needed to do in this setup program are things like ""grant the logon as service privilege to an account."" this is rare enough that the only way to find out how to do this is to search the microsoft knowlege base and the web in general. when you search the web in general for how to do fancy things with windows nt, what you find is about 75% c code, maybe 20% vb code, and 5% everything else. yes, i know, i could translate the c code into delphi (assuming i was a sophisticated delphi programmer, not a completely inexperienced delphi programmer), but that costs as much productivity as i would supposedly gain from your supposedly more productive programming language. and fourth, i already had about 30% of the code i needed for setup in mfc format from fogbugz 2.0 setup, and a library i've been using for years to make wizards. ""why make setup at all? you already have your customers' money. good setup programs don't increase sales."" this was actually the smartest question and made me think the hardest. i came up with three reasons  decreased tech support cost. this setup program will pay for itself over the life of the code.  delight my customers. when i'm trying to get them to upgrade to 4.0, i want them to remember how painless the 3.0 installation was, so they won't hesitate because they are afraid to upgrade. i'm still using an old version of spamassassin that is becoming increasingly ineffective, even though i know the new version is much better, because i just can't bear the thought of another morning wasted. the very memory of the first spamassassin installation  all the little ssh windows, some su'ed, trying to scroll through man pages and google groups, accidentally hitting ctrlz in emacs to undo and having it suspend, trying to guess why we can't get the mta to run procmail, sorry it's too much. if spamassassin was making money off of upgraders they would have lost my business because they don't have a setup program.  win reviews. software reviewers always cast about for some kind of standardized way to rate software, even when they are comparing apples and oranges and planets and 17th century philosophers. they always have a meaningless list of things to review which can be applied to pc games, mainframe databases, web site auction software, and dna sequencing software. and setup is always on their list. a single flaw in setup is guaranteed to be mentioned in every review because every reviewer will see it and say ""aha!"" ""how can we make wise4 better?"" kudos to the product manager of wise installation system for calling me up and listening to my litany of all the reasons his product wasn't adequate for typical iisaspsql applications. 1 2 3 4",[],6857,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""0 control panel3"", ""1 mozilla4"", ""2 emacs5"", ""3 dos home"", ""4 dos work"", ""5 dos incoming"" (each of which gives me a command line, but in different directories), ""7 python6"", ""9 ie"". also "" explorer home"", ""$ explorer work"", ""% explorer incoming"", which open explorer windows in various useful directories (the same directories as the dos shortcuts, only with the shift key held down, and yes, i intentionally set it up so that $ went to my work folder). lessused programs are taken out of their useless submenus (as installed) and moved directly into the programs submenu and given unique first letters as needed. ""adaware7"", ""excel8"", ""im"", ""netscape 49"", ""paint shop pro"", ""query tool (odbc)10"", ""vmware11"", ""word12"". all other submenus except startup are removed from the programs menu. (yes, delete ""accessories"". do you honestly ever use it? if so, it's probably a sign of a larger productivity problem.) things which never need to be run manually (like winzip and quicktime) are removed from the programs menu. maintaining a clean programs menu is an ongoing struggle, but well worth it. on most modern keyboards, there is a key next to your left alt key that opens the start menu, which you can press with your left thumb without taking your fingers off the home keys. otherwise ctrl esc always works. menu 4 gives me a new command prompt in my work directory. menu p n runs netscape 4 (for compatibility testing in my day job, ugh). mozilla and emacs are almost always open, but i quit lesserused applications as soon as i'm done using them (mostly because my laptop doesn't have a lot of memory). i install cygwin13 so that the command line is actually useful. cygwin is a collection of windows ports of all your favorite unix utilities, including mv, cp, scp, ssh, man, tar, less, grep, patch, ncftp, cvs, and many others. and bash, which i don't use because i dislike how it handles windows pathnames. i also set the properties of my command line shortcuts to set the window size to 120 x 50 (almost full screen at 1024 x 768), and screen buffer size to 120 x 3000. set window position at 0 x 0, and don't let the system position the window. in mozilla, i set my home page to ""aboutblank"", set internet search to search with google, use tabbed browsing, open tabs instead of windows in all possible cases, always show the tab bar, and load links in the background (essential for weblog surfing, you can ctrl click links to open them in new tabs in the background). under scripts  plugins, i do not allow scripts to open unrequested windows. i turn off the sidebar, turn on the site navigation bar, delete all preinstalled bookmarks, and create two bookmarks one which takes me to my webmail, and another which takes me to my internal site search14, from which i can find all other bookmarks i need. in internet explorer, i set my home page to the page to edit my weblog, since that's the only thing i do in internet explorer. alt tab back and forth between mozilla and ie is easier than ctrl pguppgdown between tabs within mozilla, since textareas in mozilla lose focus when you switch tabs, making copying and pasting weblog entries virtually impossible. i use emacs locally and vi remotely, because the default behavior of emacs is so heinous as to render it unusable. (for instance, editing a cgi script named foo.cgi on a web server with emacs would generate a foo.cgi backup file, which is worldreadable and is sent as plain text to any browser that asks. try this sometime on your favorite web site.) among other things, my .emacs file (which is actually called emacs on windows) instructs emacs to store all backup files in a single directory (dbackup) to treat all xml files as docbook, all cgi scripts as python, and all sql scripts as plsql to use cygwin's bash shell for mxshell to use a single maximized frame with no menubar, titled as the name of the current file to show column numbers to accept ""y"" and ""n"" for yesno questions not to blink not to beep and to close the current file when i press mw. i use some weird registry hacks and a hacked notepad.exe to get all text files to open in emacs. (i got this idea from ultraedit15.) my emacs file is my second most backedup possession. i don't use windows' useless directory structure for user home directories. on my d drive i have dhome (contains directories for my books and other personal projects, each under cvs control8212also set as my home directory using the home environment variable), dwork (contains directories for each work project, also under cvs), dincoming (set as default download directory for all programs that download things), and dbackup (used by emacs, and for temporary storage, for instance for storing originals when checking out newly created cvs projects). i don't know or care what's where on my c drive. i have tried many, many address books, and still store all my contacts, email addresses, snail mail addresses, phone numbers, and other vital personal information in a text file called phone, stored in dhomephone. it is not in any particular format, other than being plain text and usually including blank lines between entries. i categorize people with simple keywords in parentheses after their name, and use mxoccur in emacs to search by keyword. this file is my single most backedup possession. other essential free windows utilities i use (in no particular order) tweakui 16, cygwin17, guidescope18, zonealarm19. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 replacing notepad with ultraedit32 16 17 18 19",[],7295,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(it has escaped nobody's notice that the ruling party, the bharatiya janata party (bjp), or indian people's party, and the hindu extremists of the vishwa hindu parishad (vhp), or world hindu council, are sister organizations and offshoots of the same parent body.) even some international commentators, such as britain's independent newspaper, urge us to ""beware excess pessimism."" the horrible truth about communal slaughter in india is that we're used to it. it happens every so often then it dies down. that's how life is, folks. most of the time india is the world's largest secular democracy and if, once in a while, it lets off a little crazy religious steam, we mustn't let that distort the picture. of course, there are political explanations. ever since december 1992, when a vhp mob demolished a 400yearold muslim mosque in ayodhya, which they claim was built on the sacred birthplace of the god ram, hindu fanatics have been looking for this fight. the pity of it is that some muslims were ready to give it to them. their murderous attack on the trainload of vhp activists at godhra (with its awful, atavistic echoes of the killings of hindus and muslims by the trainload during the partition riots of 1947) played right into the hindu extremists' hands. the vhp has evidently tired of what it sees as the equivocations and insufficient radicalism of india's bjp government. prime minister atal bihari vajpayee is more moderate than his party he also heads a coalition government and has been obliged to abandon much of the bjp's more extreme hindu nationalist rhetoric to hold the coalition together. but it isn't working anymore. in state elections across the country, the bjp is being trounced. this may have been the last straw for the vhp firebrands. why put up with the government's betrayal of their fascistic agenda when that betrayal doesn't even result in electoral success? the electoral failure of the bjp is thus, in all probability, the spark that lit the fire. the vhp is determined to build a hindu temple on the site of the demolished ayodhya mosque  that's where the godhra dead were coming from  and there are, reprehensibly, idiotically, tragically, muslims in india equally determined to resist them. vajpayee has insisted that the slow indian courts must decide the rights and wrongs of the ayodhya issue. the vhp is no longer prepared to wait. the distinguished indian writer mahasveta devi, in a letter to india's president, k. r. narayanan, blames the gujarat government (led by a bjp hardliner) as well as the central government for doing ""too little too late."" she pins the blame firmly on the ""motivated, wellplanned out and provocative actions"" of the hindu nationalists. but another writer, the nobel laureate v. s. naipaul, speaking in india just a week before the violence erupted, denounced india's muslims en masse and praised the nationalist movement. the murderers of godhra must indeed be denounced, and mahasveta devi in her letter demands ""stern legal action"" against them. but the vhp is determined to destroy that secular democracy in which india takes such public pride and which it does so little to protect and by supporting them, naipaul makes himself a fellow traveler of fascism and disgraces the nobel award. the political discourse matters, and explains a good deal. but there's something beneath it, something we don't want to look in the face namely, that in india, as elsewhere in our darkening world, religion is the poison in the blood. where religion intervenes, mere innocence is no excuse. yet we go on skating around this issue, speaking of religion in the fashionable language of ""respect."" what is there to respect in any of this, or in any of the crimes now being committed almost daily around the world in religion's dreaded name? how well, with what fatal results, religion erects totems, and how willing we are to kill for them! and when we've done it often enough, the deadening of affect that results makes it easier to do it again. so india's problem turns out to be the world's problem. what happened in india has happened in god's name. the problem's name is god. salman rushdie is a novelist and author of the forthcoming essay collection ""step across this line.""  2002 the washington post company sdw  stephen d. williams 43392 wayside cir,ashburn,va 201474622 7037240118w 7039950407fax dec2001",[],6494,0,0,easy_ham_testing

i hope the incessant kneejerk conformist screeching that americans see coming from europe doesn't actually represent the views of europeans. for various reasons i'm not exactly a cheerleader for the us government, but the premises of the argument against them here are lame.  my personal point is that few americans (percentage of overall population)  have ever left their country, while even german construction workers  regularly spend their holidays in spain. so i'm not surprised that  paranoia is growing. i'm betting you are underestimating the actual percentage. the vast majority of people i know have lived, worked, and traveled outside the country at one time or another. and i doubt europeans have traveled anywhere near as much in the western hemisphere as americans have. despite the best efforts of france, europe is still not the center of the universe. i'll throw you a bone though most americans do consider europe to be drifting into irrelevancy and therefore ignore it. but from the perspective of an american, how could you not look at it this way? the impact of europe on america has diminished greatly over the years. i love the smell of eurochauvinism in the morning. first, you assume that the north american continent is ethnically and culturally homogenous. anybody that has actually traveled throughout north america knows this isn't true there are more than five major and very distinct cultures and societies in the us alone, never mind the hundreds of diverse regional subpopulations, some of which are truly foreign. apparently europeans confuse speaking the same language with having the same culture. that would be like saying mexico is culturally identical to spain because they nominally speak the same language. a wyoming rancher has almost nothing in common culturally or socially with your average person living in san francisco, despite speaking the same language and nominally living in the same country. if i want to visit a wildly different culture for the holidays, i'll go to oakland, new orleans, or similar  they are far more different from where i live than some countries i've traveled to. and a lot of these places are farther from where i live than spain is from germany. second, the state i live in is the size of germany. when i travel to a neighboring state (which i do regularly), how is this not equivalent? in fact, i probably travel much farther for the holidays than your german construction workers. if you look at the eu as a single country, only then does your analogy become comparable. what kind of ridiculous superiority do europeans get from having (relatively) tiny countries? in truth, i find europe to be about as culturally homogeneous as the us. there are a lot of cultural similarities across the eu with relatively minor local deviations that vary with distance in ways very similar to the us. the only real difference is that europeans have dozens of different languages, which is hardly something i would call an advantage. although there are a couple parts of the us where i can't understand a word they are saying either. james rogers",[],6445,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""the government condemned them to live in poverty. in any other country, they would be the objects of special care,"" jose sandoval, author of ""mother aged 5,"" told reuters. ""we still have time to repair the damage done to her. that's my fundamental objective,"" he added. 'totally willing to help' sandoval has raised medina's case with the office of first lady eliane karp, and has asked the government to grant her a life pension  something officials say is possible. ""we're totally willing to help her,"" said spokeswoman marta castaneda. but suni ramos, of the social action department of karp's office, said that before the government could grant her a pension or any other of the aid it was already planning  such as kitchen and other household equipment  it needed to talk to her to discuss what she wanted and needed. it is currently trying to contact medina and her family. medina's husband, raul jurado, told reuters his wife remained skeptical. ""she got no help (in 1939) that i know about,"" he said. ""she thinks governments never deliver. maybe today there will be a promise that will never come true."" jurado said his wife, whose story is a medical textbook classic and whose case is confirmed as true by such bodies as the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists, had turned down reuters' request for an interview. medical rarity no one has ever established who was the father of medina's child, or confirmed she became pregnant after being raped. one of nine children born to country folk in ticrapo, an andean village at an altitude of 7,400 feet (2,250 meters) in peru's poorest province, medina is believed to be the youngest case of precocious puberty in history, sandoval said. he said she had her first period at 2 12, became pregnant aged 4 years and eight months and that when doctors performed the caesarean to deliver her baby, they found she already had fully mature sexual organs. her swelling stomach worried her parents. ""they thought it was a tumor,"" he said. but shamans ruled out village superstitions  including one in which locals believed a snake grew inside a person until it killed them  and recommended they take her to hospital in the nearest big town, pisco. there came the staggering diagnosis that she was pregnant. her father was jailed temporarily on suspicion of incest  he was later released for lack of evidence  and doctors, police and even a film crew set off for her village for preliminary investigations into her case. sandoval, who based his book on media and other published information, and some interviews with relatives as medina herself declined to comment, said news of the child mothertobe drew instant offers of aid, including one worth $5,000 from a u.s. businessman, which was turned down. more offers followed after medina was transferred to a lima hospital, where her fully developed 6pound (2.7 kg) baby was born on may 14, 1939  mother's day. one offer was worth $1,000 a week, plus expenses, for medina and her baby to be exhibited at the world's fair in new york. another, from a u.s. business that the family accepted in early june 1939, was for the pair to travel to the united states for scientists to study the case. the offer included setting up a fund to ensure their lifelong financial comfort. but within days, the state trumped all previous offers, decreeing that medina and her baby were in ""moral danger,"" and resolving to set up a special commission to protect them. but sandoval said ""it abandoned the case after six months ...it did absolutely nothing for them."" happy ending? though physically mature, medina  who sandoval said was mentally normal and showed no other unusual medical symptoms  still behaved like a child, preferring to play with her dolls instead of the new baby, who was fed by a wet nurse. medina stayed in hospital for 11 months, finally returning to her family after it began legal proceedings that led to a supreme court ruling allowing her to live with them again. after taunting from schoolmates, gerardo  who was named after one of the doctors who attended medina and became their mentor  discovered when he was 10 that the woman he had grown up believing to be his sister was in fact his mother. he died in 1979 from a disease that attacks the body's bone marrow, but sandoval said it was not clear there was any link with his illness and the fact his mother had been so young. medina married and in 1972 had a second son, 33 years after her first. her second child now lives in mexico. she appears to have turned her bizarre story into a taboo subject. ""we just want to get on with our lives, that's it,"" said jurado, adding he thought ""absolutely nothing"" of the fact his wife was the world's youngest mother. he said the couple's main concern now, if the government's offer of aid was genuine, was to be granted the value of a property that belonged to medina and which the thengovernment expropriated more than two decades ago. that house has now been destroyed and there is a road on the site. he said its value was ""more or less $25,000"" and settling the property question would conclude a long legal battle to get back a home of their own  they live now in a modest house, accessed down a dingy alley half blocked by a wooden board, in a tough neighborhood known to locals as a thieves' paradise. ""if the government really wants to help...they should give us the value of our property,"" he said. as for sandoval, he said he was optimistic that medina's story, which he has studied since his student days, would turn out well. ""i believe there will be a happy ending,"" he said.

anyone remember the polariod photo sticker fad? low quality, small in size. but kids totally dug that stuff. seems like every adolescent girl had that stuff at one point. and it never replaced or aimed to replace digital cameras or normal photographs. i don't think mms photos will be a substitute for other photography  developed at the local 1 hour joint or digital photos on your pc. i think it expands the market and forms a new category. the extent of the category size is the big question (will it be a fad or will it a sustained market). that's consumer behavior and marketing. but i don't think the technology adoption will follow a substitution of another product on the market (in this case, digital photos or normal photos). europe's the one to watch  more teenagers have wireless phones and if the pricing and marketing is right, they'll figure out what to do with it once the carriers how to figure out how to market it to them. h from ""rob shavell"" to ""'mike masnick'"" cc subject re sprint delivers the next big thing?? date wed, 21 aug 2002 011050 0700  right mike,  i will agree to disagree but i take your comments to heart. my opinion is only that this is one of the last frontiers of communications ('instant show') that we cross easily (though you are right as rain on pricing). i am mildly amused at the level of skepticism and innatention it is getting.  my premise is that the world will change in dramatic and unexpected ways once there are a billion 'eye's' which can instantly share what they see amongst each other. that doesn't mean that people will stop talking on their phones, or that people will spend more time wimages than voice. just that it is fundamental. from news to crime to privacy to dating to family life to bloopers and practical jokes, i believe there will be an explosion of images unleashed specifically by cell phone integrated lenses because of their utter ubiquity that dwarfs all pictures taken in the history of photography by orders of magnitude and in short order. and yes, changes things 'big time'.  rgds, rob   original message from mike masnick sent tuesday, august 20, 2002 1158 pm to rob shavell cc subject re sprint delivers the next big thing??   not to keep harping on this, but...  at 1136 pm 82002 0700, rob shavell wrote  content who cares about content? that no one can think of 'useful' content is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users communications. its anything and everything. avg person could easily send half dozen pics to a dozen people a day. mainly humorous i'd guess. who cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words.  this does nothing to answer my question. i do care about content. hell, if i could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day, i'd have a different opinion of this. i just am not convinced that they will (stupid or not).  while a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who communicate by pictures? sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something?  i don't buy it.  for most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism. for some messages, pictures do the job, but i would say not nearly as often as words. why do you think pictionary and charades and such are games? because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across.  misc ramblings i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same thing about '1 hour photo' processing. trivial, who needs it, i get better resultion elswhere. and yet, it had great decentralizing impact  the plant had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation  the digital camera, and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way. also, sms didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less. its greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their sms traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth. in reality, sms cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle.  again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with ""you just don't understand kids today, and they'll run with this""). i wasn't saying that mms wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't easy. i was saying that i couldn't see why people would use it in a way that ""changed the face of communications"".  i'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why people would want to do this. sure, if they integrate cameras into the phone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) i can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people. but, mostly, i don't see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or offline) photoalbum.  i don't think 1 hour photos are trivial. people want to see their own pics right away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots. that's one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on. the instant view part. i'm guessing your argument is that people not only want ""instant view"", but also ""instant show"". which is what this service offers. i'm not convinced that most people want ""instant show"". i think people like to package their pictures and show them. that's why people put together fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture. sure, occasionally ""instant show"" is nice, but it's just ""nice"" on occasion. i still can't see how it becomes a integral messaging method.  what's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another? there has to be some benefit, even if it's silly if people are going to flock to it.  i'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet.  the only really intriguing idea i've heard about things like mms lately are dan gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of what happened  before the press even gets there.  willing to be proven wrong, mike  ps if the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are, then mms is never going to catch on.",[],7240,0,0,easy_ham_testing

i knew you could... given that an undergraduate liberal arts degree from a state school, like, say, mine, ), is nothing but stuff they should have taught you in a governmentrun ""high"" school, you'll probably get more of those on the forbes 400 as well as time goes on. if we ever get around to having a good old fashioned governmentcollapsing transferpayment depression (an economic version of this summer's governmentforest conflagration, caused by the same kind of innumeracy that not clearcutting enough forests did out west this summer )) that should motivate more than a few erstslackers out there, including me, ), to learn to actually feed themselves. the next category on the forbes 400 list is someone with a ""terminal"" professional degree, like an mba, phd, md, etc., from the best school possible. why? because, as of about 1950, the best way to get into harvard, for instance, is to be smart, not rich. don't take my word for it, ask their admissions office. look at the admissions stats over the years for proof. meritocracy, american style, was invented at the ivy league after world war ii. even stanford got the hint, ), and, of course, chicago taught them all how, right? ). practically nobody who goes to a top20 american institution of higher learning can actually afford to go there these days. unless, of course, their parents, who couldn't afford to go there themselves, got terminal degrees in the last 40 years or so. and their kids still had to get the grades, and ""biased"" (by intelligence )), test scores, to get in. the bizarre irony is that almost all of those people with ""terminal"" degrees, until they actually own something and hire people, or learn to make something for a living all day on a profit and loss basis, persist in the practically insane belief, like life after death, that economics is some kind of zero sum game, that dumb people who don't work hard for it make all the money, and, if someone is smart, works hard, and is rich, then they stole their wealth somehow. btw, none of you guys out there holding the short end of this rhetorical stick can blame me for the fact that i'm using it to beat you severely all over your collective head and shoulders. you were, apparently, too dumb to grab the right end. i went to missouri, and i don't have a degree in anything actually useful, much less a ""terminal"" one, which means i'm broker than anyone on this list  it's just that you, of all people, lots with educations far surpassing my own, should just plain know better. the facts speak for themselves, if you just open your eyes and look. there are no epicycles, the universe does not orbit the earth, and economics is not a zerosum game. the cost of anything, including ignorance and destitution, is the forgone alternative, in this case, intelligence and effort. i will, however, admit to being educated waay past my level of competence, and, by the way you discuss economics, so have you, apparently. btw, if we ever actually had free markets in this country, including the abolition of redistributive income and death taxes, all those smart people in the forbes 400 would have more money, and there would be more selfmade people on that list. in addition, most of the people who inherited money on the list would have much less of it, not even relatively speaking. finally, practically all of that ""new"" money would have come from economic efficiency and not ""stolen"" from someone else, investment bubbles or not. that efficiency is called ""progress"", for those of you in the people's republics of berkeley or cambridge. it means more and better stuff, cheaper, over time  a terrible, petitbourgeois concept apparently not worthy of teaching by the educational elite, or you'd know about it by now. in economic terms, it's also called an increase in general welfare, and, no, virginia, i'm not talking about extorting money from someone who works, and giving it to someone who doesn't in order to keep them from working and they can think of some politician as santa claus come election time... in short, then, economics is not a zero sum game, property is not theft, the rich don't get rich off the backs of the poor, and redistributionist labor ""theory"" of value happy horseshit is just that horseshit, happy or otherwise. to believe otherwise, is  quite literally, given the time marx wrote capital and the manifesto  romantic nonsense. cheers, rah begin pgp signature version pgp 7.5 iqaawubpy511cpxh8jf3ohaeqlasgcfzhsqmsvuy6gqj5wgl52dwzkpihmanrur yybocicylp5tlkl58jpwefu z877 end pgp signature   r. a. hettinga mailto the internet bearer underwriting corporation  44 farquhar street, boston, ma 02131 usa ""... however it may deserve respect for its usefulness and antiquity, predicting the end of the world has not been found agreeable to experience.""  edward gibbon, 'decline and fall of the roman empire'",[],7126,0,0,easy_ham_testing

not to keep harping on this, but... at 1136 pm 82002 0700, rob shavell wrote content who cares about content? that no one can think of 'useful' content is always the business persons mistake. the content is the users communications. its anything and everything. avg person could easily send half dozen pics to a dozen people a day. mainly humorous i'd guess. who cares if content is trivial in nature. picture speaks a thousand words. this does nothing to answer my question. i do care about content. hell, if i could be convinced that people would send stupid pics back and forth all day, i'd have a different opinion of this. i just am not convinced that they will (stupid or not). while a picture may be worth a thousand words (and this is the same argument the guy who works for me made), how many people do you know who communicate by pictures? sure, it sounds nice to say that a picture is such an efficient messaging mechanism, but how often do you actually find yourself drawing someone a picture to explain something? i don't buy it. for most messages, text works fine and is the most efficient mechanism. for some messages, pictures do the job, but i would say not nearly as often as words. why do you think pictionary and charades and such are games? because images are usually not the most efficient way to get a message across. misc ramblings i suppose you skeptical forkers would have said the same thing about '1 hour photo' processing. trivial, who needs it, i get better resultion elswhere. and yet, it had great decentralizing impact  the plant had to be downsized and pushed to the retail operation  the digital camera, and finally the integrated digital camera phone brings this cycle of decentralization in photography to a logical conclusion (which will put the photo giants to bed) and change the world in a meaningful way. also, sms didn't take off because its easy, it took off because it costs less. its greatly ironic the carriers often trumpet the 'profitabilty' of their sms traffic over others because of its ratio of cost to bandwidth. in reality, sms cannibilizes the voice rev's they bought their networks to handle. again, this is the same argument my colleague made (along with ""you just don't understand kids today, and they'll run with this""). i wasn't saying that mms wouldn't take off because it wasn't high quality or that it wasn't easy. i was saying that i couldn't see why people would use it in a way that ""changed the face of communications"". i'm looking for the compelling reason (even if it's a stupid one) why people would want to do this. sure, if they integrate cameras into the phone, and the quality improves (even only marginally) i can certainly see people taking pictures with their cameras and occasionally sending them to other people. but, mostly, i don't see what the benefit is to this over sending them to someone's email address, or putting together an online (or offline) photoalbum. i don't think 1 hour photos are trivial. people want to see their own pics right away, and the quality is plenty good enough for snapshots. that's one of the main reasons why digital cameras are catching on. the instant view part. i'm guessing your argument is that people not only want ""instant view"", but also ""instant show"". which is what this service offers. i'm not convinced that most people want ""instant show"". i think people like to package their pictures and show them. that's why people put together fancy albums, and sit there and force you to go through them while they explain every picture. sure, occasionally ""instant show"" is nice, but it's just ""nice"" on occasion. i still can't see how it becomes a integral messaging method. what's the specific benefit of taking a picture and immediately sending it from one phone to another? there has to be some benefit, even if it's silly if people are going to flock to it. i'm searching... no one has given me a straight answer yet. the only really intriguing idea i've heard about things like mms lately are dan gillmor's assertion that one day in the near future some news event will happen, and a bunch of people will snap pictures with their mobile phones, from all different angles, and those photos tell the real story of what happened  before the press even gets there. willing to be proven wrong, mike ps if the wireless carriers continue to price these services as stupidly as they currently are, then mms is never going to catch on.",[],5787,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""the council... called upon loyal anglicans to pray specifically that rowan williams would see the error in his teaching, change his views or stand down,"" it said. the society claimed to have drawn up an ""action plan,"" including calling on bishops and primates of the 70 million worldwide anglican communion, of which archbishops of canterbury are the leaders, to distance themselves from dr williams's doctrinal and ethical position. it promised it would be ""taking steps towards appropriate direct action"". it added that dr williams remained on the editorial board of a journal called theology and sexuality which, six months ago, published articles allegedly commending homosexual behaviour. despite its claim, the society does not represent the common mind of the church. dr williams, currently archbishop of wales, was chosen by the crown appointments commission of church members, including evangelicals, and his appointment was endorsed by the prime minister and the queen. he is due to succeed george carey, who retires this month, and will be formally enthroned at canterbury cathedral in february. asked what form direct action might take, the rev george curry, the society's chairman, said ""watch this space."" presumably it could involve a small minority of parishes repudiating the new archbishop and seeking alternative oversight or even demonstrations at services where dr williams is present. church of england bishops, who have hitherto largely kept their heads down during the row, are meeting next week to discuss their response to the evangelical extremists' challenge, which appears to have grown in the absence of a robust rebuttal. a letter by senior theologians in today's guardian, however, repudiates the evangelicals' tactics, calling them unseemly and contrary to biblical teaching. on the bbc's thought for the day yesterday, angela tilby, viceprincipal of westcott house, cambridge, accused dr williams's opponents of presumption and blackmail. ""it is in fact a thoroughly aggressive way to behave. it is attempting to force an issue by emotional violence... manipulating to get your way is often preferable to painstaking negotiation,"" she said. last week, dr williams said he was deeply saddened. ""matters of sexuality should not have the priority or centrality that reform and the church society have tried to give them. the archbishop cannot withdraw his appointment since so many, including evangelicals, have urged him to take the post... the archbishop believes it to be his duty under god.""  yahoo! groups sponsor  sell a home with ease!  to unsubscribe from this group, send an email to your use of yahoo! groups is subject to",[],4583,0,0,easy_ham_testing

there's a brief discussion of this before the definition of maxdiscriminators. all clues with prob minspamprob and maxspamprob are saved in min and max lists, and all other clues are fed into the nbest heap. then the shorter of the min and max lists cancels out the same number of clues in the longer list. whatever remains of the longer list (if anything) is then fed into the nbest heap too, but no more than maxdiscriminators of them. in no case do more than maxdiscriminators clues enter into the final probability calculation, but all of the min and max lists go into the list of clues (else you'd have no clue that massive cancellation was occurring and massive cancellation may yet turn out to be a hook to signal that manual review is needed). in your specific case, the excess of clues in the longer maxspamprob list pushed everything else out of the nbest heap, and that's why you didn't see anything other than 0.01 and 0.99. before adding these special lists, the outcome when faced with many 0.01 and 0.99 clues was too often a coin toss whichever flavor just happened to appear maxdiscriminators2  1 times first determined the final outcome.  that sure sets the record for longest list of cancelling extreme clues!  this happened to be the longest one, but there were quite a few  similar ones. i just beat it wink a tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores punctuation, and strips a trailing 's' from words, and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams, turned up a lowprobability very long spam with a list of 410 0.01 clues and 125 0.99 clues! yikes.  i wonder if there's anything we can learn from looking at the clues and the  html. it was heavily markedup html, with ads in the sidebar, but the body  text was a serious discussion of ""oo and soft coding"" with lots of highly  technical words as clues (including zope and zeo). no matter how often it says zope, it gets only one 0.01 clue from doing so. ditto for zeo. in contrast, html markup has many unique ""words"" that get 0.99. btw, this is a clear case where the assumption of conditionallyindependent word probabilities is utterly bogus  e.g., the probability that ""body"" appears in a message is highly correlated with the prob of ""br"" appearing. by treating them as independent, naive bayes grossly misjudges the probability that both appear, and the only thing you get in return is something that can actually be computed wink. read the ""what about html?"" section in tokenizer.py. from the very start, i've been investigating what would work best for the mailing lists hosted at python.org, and html decorations have so far been too strong a clue to justify ignoring it in that specific context. i haven't done anything geared toward personal email, including the case of nonmailinglist email that happens to go through python.org. i'd prefer to strip html tags from everything, but last time i tried that it still had bad effects on the error rates in my corpora (the full test results with and without html tag stripping is included in the ""what about html?"" comment block). but as the comment block also says,  xxx so, if another way is found to slash the fn rate, the decision here  xxx not to strip html from htmlonly msgs should be revisited. and we've since done several things that gave significant fn rate reductions. i should test that again now.  are there any minablebutunmined header lines in your corpus left? almost all of them  apart from mime decorations that appear in both headers and bodies (like contenttype), the only header lines the base tokenizer looks at now are subject, from, xmailer, and organization.  or do we have to start with a different corpus before we can make  progress there? i would need different data, yes. my ham is too polluted with mailman header decorations (which i may or may not be able to clean out, but fudging the data is a mortal sin and i haven't changed a byte so far), and my spam too polluted with header clues about the fellow who collected it. in particular i have to skip to and received headers now, and i suspect they're going to be very valuable in real life (for example, i don't even catch ""undisclosed recipients"" in the to header now!).  ...  no, sorry. these were all of the following structure   multipartmixed  textplain (brief text plus url(s))  texthtml (long html copied from website) ah! that explains why the html tags didn't get stripped. i'd again offer to add an optional argument to tokenize() so that they'd get stripped here too, but if it gets glossed over a third time that would feel too much like a loss wink.  this seems confused jeremy didn't use my trained classifier pickle,  he trained his own classifier from scratch on his own corpora.  ...  i think it's still corpus size. i reported on tests i ran with random samples of 220 spams and 220 hams from my corpus (that means training on sets of those sizes as well as predicting on sets of those sizes), and while that did harm the error rates, the error rates i saw were still much better than jeremy reported when using 500 of each. ah, a full test run just finished, on the tokenization scheme that folds case, and ignores punctuation, and strips a trailing 's' from words, and saves both word bigrams and word unigrams this is the code  tokenize everything in the body. lastw  '' for w in wordre.findall(text) n  len(w)  make sure this range matches in tokenizeword(). if 3  n  12 if w1  's' w  w1 yield w if lastw yield lastw  w lastw  w  ' ' elif n  3 lastw  '' for t in tokenizeword(w) yield t where wordre  re.compile(r""w$x80xff"") this at least doubled the process size over what's done now. it helped the fn rate significantly, but probably hurt the fp rate (the fp rate is too low with only 4000 hams per run to be confident about changes of such small absolute magnitude  0.025% is a single message in the fp table) false positive percentages 0.000 0.000 tied 0.000 0.075 lost (was 0) 0.050 0.125 lost 150.00% 0.025 0.000 won 100.00% 0.075 0.025 won 66.67% 0.000 0.050 lost (was 0) 0.100 0.175 lost 75.00% 0.050 0.050 tied 0.025 0.050 lost 100.00% 0.025 0.000 won 100.00% 0.050 0.125 lost 150.00% 0.050 0.025 won 50.00% 0.050 0.050 tied 0.000 0.025 lost (was 0) 0.000 0.025 lost (was 0) 0.075 0.050 won 33.33% 0.025 0.050 lost 100.00% 0.000 0.000 tied 0.025 0.100 lost 300.00% 0.050 0.150 lost 200.00% won 5 times tied 4 times lost 11 times total unique fp went from 13 to 21 false negative percentages 0.327 0.218 won 33.33% 0.400 0.218 won 45.50% 0.327 0.218 won 33.33% 0.691 0.691 tied 0.545 0.327 won 40.00% 0.291 0.218 won 25.09% 0.218 0.291 lost 33.49% 0.654 0.473 won 27.68% 0.364 0.327 won 10.16% 0.291 0.182 won 37.46% 0.327 0.254 won 22.32% 0.691 0.509 won 26.34% 0.582 0.473 won 18.73% 0.291 0.255 won 12.37% 0.364 0.218 won 40.11% 0.436 0.327 won 25.00% 0.436 0.473 lost 8.49% 0.218 0.218 tied 0.291 0.255 won 12.37% 0.254 0.364 lost 43.31% won 15 times tied 2 times lost 3 times total unique fn went from 106 to 94",[],8282,0,0,easy_ham_testing

""the demand for instant recall of archived data is expanding as companies are meeting their obligations to quickly access executive emails, financial documents and transaction records,"" said mike dooley, senior director of marketing for the desktop products group at maxtor. ""users may not need to access information in these applications on a daily basis, but when they do need access, it must be instant. recent advances in ata technology and our manufacturing processes allow us to build upon our legacy of experience and provide our customers with a family of premium ata hard drives that can be integrated into a variety of systems for these enterprise applications."" the maxline family includes the 5400rpm maxline ii, designed for capacities up to 320 gb and the 7200rpm maxline plus ii, designed for capacities up to 250 gb. at these capacities, maxline offers higher storage density than many tape and optical solutions. these drives have also been tested and are projected to meet enterprise reliability requirements, already exceeded by prior drives employing the same robust maxtor designs, which exceed mttf of over one million hours. these drives will also carry a threeyear warranty. the maxline ii and maxline plus ii feature the maxtor fast drivetm ultraata133 interface for data transfer speeds up to 133 mb per second. the maxline ii and maxline plus ii will be available with nextgeneration serial ata interface for higher performance. at 150 mb per second maximum data transfer rate, serial ata improves hard drive performance to keep pace with the rapidly increasing performance requirements of data intensive environments and enterprise applications. with a pointtopoint connection architecture, and rich command set for managing hard drive activity and data flow along the interface, serial ata advances the performance and efficiency of the drive to system interface. the interface's reduced pin count allows for simpler cabling which in turn allows better airflow within a system and further benefits the user with increased design flexibility and hot plug capability. ""maxtor's maxline family of drives provide a solution for storing data that has previously been too expensive to keep on disk,"" said dave reinsel, analyst at idc. ""the ata drives offer a great value, low cost per gb and when integrated into storage systems and file servers offer a compelling costeffective alternative to tape libraries and optical drives, which have been the traditional solutions used for nearline applications."" availability limited qualification units of the parallel ata versions of maxtor maxline ii and maxline plus ii are now available with volume units available in the fourth quarter. qualification units of the maxline ii and maxline plus ii with serial ata will be available later this month with volume shipments scheduled to begin in the first quarter of 2003. about maxtor maxtor corporation ( is one of the world's leading suppliers of information storage solutions. the company has an expansive line of storage products for desktop computers, storage systems, highperformance servers and consumer electronics. maxtor has a reputation as a proven market leader built by consistently providing highquality products and service and support for its customers. maxtor and its products can be found at or by calling tollfree (800) 2maxtor. maxtor is traded on the nyse under the mxo symbol. note maxtor, maxline and the maxtor logo are registered trademarks of maxtor corporation. fast drive is a trademark of maxtor corporation. all other trademarks are properties of their respective owners. gb means 1 billion bytes. total accessible capacity varies depending on operating environment. this announcement relating to maxtor may contain forwardlooking statements concerning future technology, products incorporating that technology, and maxtor's execution. these statements are based on current expectations and are subject to risks and uncertainties which could materially affect the company's results, including, but not limited to, market demand for hard disk drives, the company's ability to execute future production ramps and utilize manufacturing assets efficiently, pricing, competition, and the significant uncertainty of market acceptance of new products. these and other risk factors are contained in documents that the company files with the sec, including the form 10k for fiscal 2001 and its recent 10qs. copyright  2001, maxtor corporation . privacy policy.

sheikh abu hamza almasri, our maddest of mad mullahs and a cartoon bogeyman to scare the kiddies, spent a quiet and contemplative bank holiday playing with his own children in victoria park, hackney. i've often wondered what incendiary islamic fundamentalist clerics do on statutory public holidays. head for the beach and maybe swing by bq on the way home, i had hoped. i had this beguiling vision of hamza paddling in the sea, an icecream cone in his one good hand, the waves tickling his shins, and the sheikh mentally preparing to fix those pesky shelves in the kitchen for once, instead of planning the extermination of zionism and america and maybe me and you, too. but bq and a day at the seaside is probably beyond hamza's budget since the bank of england froze his assets, so victoria park had to do. but he sounded happy enough when i spoke to him, with the babble of tiny, cheerful, islamic protowarriors in the background. you must know hamza he's the imam designed, it would seem, by the daily mail's cartoonist mac. large metal hook in place of a left hand. one eye covered by a patch, the other a baleful, watchful, milkywhite. we don't mock the disabled any more these days, unless it's someone like hamza whom we don't like then, if you'll excuse the inapt phraseology, the gloves come off. so hamza is known (with that vaulting imagination typical of the british right) as ""captain hook"", in articles which usually call for his arrest, or extradition to the us, or deportation back home to egypt or maybe off to pakistan or afghanistan, where he fought the russians for years and thus sustained his disabilities  anywhere, really just out of here. and if we can't lock him up or chuck him out of the country, maybe we can force him to shut up. because we don't like hamza very much. we weren't that fond of him before september 11, but afterwards, in that nervy, paranoid few months when we all thought the sky might fall in, our disapprobation turned into political persecution. and now the daily mirror is agitating again for his arrest because they've got hold of secret videos of the man behaving in an even more inflammatory manner, urging warfare on and looting of enemies of islam. all out of context, and a very long time ago, says the imam, not unduly bothered. but perhaps he should be, because our reputation for broadmindedness and tolerance towards people like hamza was thinning even before the mirror's scoop. hamza preaches, or preached, at the scary finsbury park mosque  so, earlier this year, the charity commissioners banned him from doing so because of his allegedly inflammatory remarks. i didn't know charity commissioners were meant to do stuff like that. he has had his passport seized and not returned his assets have been frozen. he is tailed by the police every now and then, and his access to the media is restricted by internal policing within broadcasting corporations and the press. and this last point is because, we tell ourselves, endlessly  repeating the mantra over and over again, and fervently wishing it to be true  hamza is not ""representative"" of british muslims, as if british muslims were a simple, homogenous thing with a single voice that one could turn to every now and then for explanation. and perhaps succour. the trouble is, in the first month or so after the twin towers attack he was revealed to be rather more ""representative"" than the list of those governmentapproved muslim spokesmen who were  uncomfortably, i suspect  dragooned briefly into statements of support for the war against terrorism and a blanket condemnation of the taliban. an opinion poll commissioned by radio 4's today programme revealed that an overwhelming majority of british muslims were against george bush's crusade. one in six were, to put it mildly, ambivalent about the attack on the us (the remainder condemned the attack unequivocally). a large majority thought the war against terrorism was a war against islam. which is what hamza said, repeatedly. but it was something that, at the time, we didn't want to hear. now, if you quiz the man on present policy at home and abroad he comes across  superficially, at least  as someone from the liberal left. no war against iraq britain to become independent of us foreign policy and attempt rapprochement with arab states stronger action against israel mistrust of global capitalism redistribution of wealth. nor is he particularly antisemitic, so far as i can tell, although i don't suppose he will be holidaying in eilat this year. in yesterday's guardian, the chief rabbi expressed a willingness to talk to hamza and was grateful for the sheikh's message of condolence when a london synagogue was attacked. which is not to say that hamza is a peaceable jeffersonian democrat who has been wilfully misrepresented he is, without question, rather more inflammatory in private sermons to his own people than he is in public. his ideology is an arid and uncompromising interpretation of islam he would be happy, in a truly islamic society, to stone women to death for adultery, for example. you and i would find many  perhaps most  of his views utterly repellent. and that's the point. because hamza is the true test of our apparent desire to be multicultural. multiculturalism is not, surely, the cheerful appropriation of bits of inoffensive minority cultural behaviour by the ruling hegemony. that is a sort of syncopated monoculturalism. multiculturalism is, rather, the ability of society to tolerate views that are antithetical to the dominant culture  and maybe learn from them. the fbi has been investigating hamza, but, of course, has found nothing remotely incriminating. the real reason for his vilification and persecution is simply the pungency of his views. it is often said that we should shut him up or arrest him because his rhetoric increases hostility against the muslim population generally. this is a perfectly noble argument, but it does not wash. you don't defuse a difficult situation by pretending it doesn't exist. and if british muslims  maybe a minority, maybe not  feel a growing sense of unease or mystification at the direction of western foreign policy, it is not because they have been led in that direction by hamza. shutting the man up, therefore, won't make a difference. it is rather as louis macneice had it the glass is falling hour by hour, the glass will fall for ever. but if you break the bloody glass, you won't hold up the weather.  yahoo! groups sponsor  4 dvds free sp join now  to unsubscribe from this

(cd username will take you to someone else's, except on mac os x, where it will take you to their public file sharing directory.) it is from this heritage that we can trace the presentday practice of using tildes in urls to denote personal pages, since one single systemwide configuration allowed individual users to have their own web sites by storing files in their own home directory. or, more commonly now that apache has taken over the world, in their publichtml subdirectory, except on mac os x, where if you turn on web sharing and point your browser to you're actually being served files from that user's sites directory within their home directory. but i don't want to talk about mac os x. i want to talk about the tilde. as with so many other things, i find that jukka korpela1 is the expert in this field. jukka is no doubt a member of my karass2, a word which google ( old habits die hard3) feels is best explained by the personal site of eugene wallingford, which, like jukka's home page, can not be referenced without a tilde. in fact, jukka has written a lengthy treatise on why the tilde should not be used in urls4, a treatise which, i feel obliged to point out, contains a tilde in its url. clearly, the tilde is underappreciated. digging further, we find this post of jukka's from 19985, in which we learn that the tilde was not meant to be the tilde at all, but rather an odd character called the overline. presumably to balance out the underline, if indeed those sorts of things require balance. there is balance in the universe, to be sure, but i am less sure that it eminates from my keyboard. no matter. the tilde was the tilde so that spanishtyping types could type the ntilde (now referenced in html as the named entity ntilde), but somewhere along the line, it morphed into a generalpurpose character with all sorts of geeky uses. digging even further, it appears that the tilde was originally an alternate for 6, then an alternate for , and its life as an overline replacement came even later. jukka confirms this7 and adds a timeline 1963 for , 1964 for , 1966 for overline. then june 30, 1966, the watershed moment in an x3 committee meeting, when it was proposed 8220as exclusively a tilde in usa to appease share8221. i can find no further reference as to what this acronym means, or what this committee meeting was about. the next reference isn't until 1991, when the tilde was officially added to iso6468. and now, down the rabbit hole we go. scouring usenet (which the kids of yesterday called 8220deja news8221, and kids today call 8220google groups8221), we find a reprint of a 1991 william safire (yes, that william safire) article on language9, in which we learn that  is officially pronounced 8220squiggle8221. this is confirmed by the jargon dictionary 10 to this very day. i'm not sure this is useful, but i just thought it was cool to see william safire writing about the proper pronunciation of various ascii characters. as early as august 1990, tilde was included in the waka waka bang splat poem 11. in july 1989, kermit gained support for filenames containing a tilde12. in february 1988, an editor's note to an otherwise unrelated article notes that fidonet supported ascii characters space through tilde13. as early as january 1987, less used the tilde to denote lines past eof14. as early as july 1986, troff supported the tilde15. in november 1985, a mod.sources post refers to bourne shell enhancements (history,tilde,job control)16. as early as january 1984, tilde was included on the dec keyboard17 and listed in the apl11 character set18. in april 1983, tilde was causing bugs in vi19 (actually due to underlying bugs in csh). in december 1982,  is officially pronounced 8220tilde822120, prompting this typographical pun21. and that's the earliest reference i can find. so where does that leave us? unsatisfied, no doubt. there is history here, but there are gaps. what happened at that watershed meeting in 1966? how did the tilde rise to prominence in the 1980s? when did it become a synonym for 8220home directory8221? when did it migrate into the world of web servers to provide a cheap and simple way of giving individual users their own web sites? i don't know, and the lateness of the hour prevents me from continuing my research, a failing for which i apologize profusely. goodnight, goodnight. may you dream of tildes, stars, and whorls. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21",[],6730,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(i use the word static versus changeable instead of writeable versus unwritable because the ""unchangeable"" partitions might be written to for temporary swap space. who knows what windows does internally?) my point is that there should be a market out there for a hardware raid device that can split designated partitions into a permanent base image partition and a temporary delta image partition, that has some simple but solid security measures to prevent the unauthorized remote modification of base images, and that can be configured to clear the delta image when the server is rebooted. if some vendor wished to implement this, they could then market this as a mechanism to help frustrate broad classes of attack that rely on the permanent modification of system or application files via buffer overflows, platform and middleware bugs, etc. the prevention of unauthorized modification of application data, of course, would not be addressed by this particular product. but there are many other techniques out there to defend application data. but those techniques all assume that your system itself has not been compromised at a lower level, which is where this product could help. i would have to think that these features would be relatively easy for a hardware raid vendor to implement. (i'm just guessing, of course, with no knowledge of how hardware raid works internally.) if anyone knows of such a product, i'd love to hear about it. ben",[],4443,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(this is generally how spamassassin works since almost everyone uses it after the smtp transaction has completed successfully.) spammer thinks everything is going fine and has no reason to try new methods. then there is a third possibility. instead of returning a 550 code indicating you're on to the spammer, fake a 5.1.1 response which is saying ""mailbox does not exist."" this would be in the hopes that some spammers out there actually remove names reported as nonexistent from their lists. i know, a slim hope, but even if only a few do, it can lower the incidence. so, what are the arguments for each? do spammers even look at any of the bounce messages they get? the volume of bounces must be huge. personally, i'm starting to think blackholes are the way to go... but sending back that ""spammer die, die, die,"" or stock ""access deenied!""

""it's like that movie the poseidon adventure. dave's like the purser ranting and raving that the passengers should follow him and march toward the bow. i don't know about you but i'd rather be with the fat lady swimming toward the engine room. the ship's fucking sinking and i don't want to be following the idiot."" dave's idea of love is fucking everyone else without so much as a reach around. you're supposed to just shut up and take it. after all, why would good ol' uncle dave want to hurt you? it's all about love, right? to hell with asking you if you want to get shafted. and if you dare complain, he savages you. then he tries to make everyone think you're the one causing all the trouble. we've news for you dave, we're wise to your tactics and we're talking amongst ourselves about it. we're routing around you damaging behavoir. that's where we're coming from. if you have an example of how you've tried to help dave, please drop us an email about it. we'll keep it strictly confidential of course. send it along to 91202 101311 am  discuss trying to talk with dave is like trying to wrestle a pig... the trouble is, you get dirty and the pig seems to like it. another developer tries talking to dave and discovers it's fundamentally impossible his basic response was just that rdf was a joke and the semantic web developers are doing a terrible job. in the span of less than five minutes dave makes such an ass of himself that people at other tables start whispering ""that guy is an idiot..."" the zaphodim, however, are veteran pig wrestlers. if you've got a similar tale from the mud pit, be sure to drop us a line at 91102 21758 pm  discuss (1 response) aha! some backing down by the whining one? it would appear the 'dictator release' strategy that dave's been trying on his crappy little set of rss hacks is failing to gain support. i'm going to push back the caveatremoving on the 2.0 spec by 24 hours. still have work to do on the sample file, i want to look into the rfc for timedate specs, and get started on the radio implementation of 2.0. i have to prepare for seybold tomorrow, and i want to a little memorial for 911. a busy few days for a guy still recovering. also, it would be great if people who make content tools could review the 2.0 spec and see if there are any dealstoppers. hell yeah there are deal stoppers, like nobody wants it nor will they use it! the poor radio customers! the poor salon blog users! they're going to be dragged unwillingly into producing xml content that nobody will use! so with the flip of his mighty upgrade switch dave is going to turn all their content into totally unsupported garbage!!! ya better speak up now folks otherwise your content is going to start getting rejected! of course at the same time dave tries to play the sympathy card. what utter fucking nonsense. this past weekend, the blogosphere excoriates him for his 'blame america' bullshit. then the rss community tells him to get stuffed with his dictator release of rss. now he's trying to pretend we should be nice to him because he's still recovering? uh, dave, if you want to take a rest from the battle then stop picking fights. we'll still kick your ass regardless. that's what years of your abusing people has gotten you dave. no sympathy anymore, none whatsoever. 91102 15610 pm  discuss dave is scary on 911 posted on scripting news on 9102002 note during the day tomorrow there will be no updates to scripting news. i'll be in sf at seybold, leading a discussion on web services for publishing with people from amazon, apple, google and jake savin of userland. i may be able to update my radio weblog, but only if there's something really important to report. so best wishes for a happy and safe 911. what kind of asshole wishes people a happy 911??!?!?!?!??!! obviously someone who doesn't have a clue nor lost anyone in the tragedy. 91102 75606 am  discuss yeow and we though we were harsh! wow, apparently dave's sticking his neck out quite far these days. craig schamp practically keelhauls him with this one. he wraps it up with the man seems to show over and over that he's nothing more than a whining buffoon give that man an honorary zaphodim membership card and secret decoder ring! related links over at photodude, richard bennett, andrea harris, reid stott, jeff jarvis, ipse dixit, and the fat guy. 9902 122945 pm  discuss rss 2.0 code name ""hitler"" if dave tries to steamroll rss 2.0 through without formal community consensus, here now we call it the ""hitler"" release of 2.0. ""no objections""? no, he means ""no objections i choose to hear."" dave is simply not listening. people are objecting all over. 9602 90002 am  discuss referral log funnies every now and then we check the referral logs to see what's pointing back to us. we sincerely apologize to the pool soul that used this search. 9502 121507 pm  discuss luserland attempts to trademark ""rss"" dave has waxed and waned about intellectual property rights and how any bigco that tries to patent its technology or methods is corrupt or morally bankrupt. scripting news is full of examples. so we found it surprising, as did many others, when luserland software tried to patent the term 'rss' back in 2000. here's the patent application this was apparently just between the start of the rss 1.0 development efforts, and the publication of the specification. winer knew about the rss 1.0 stuff  indeed, he complained about it bitterly at the time. could dave be any more transparent?!?!??!?!!!!!!! since when has dave been required to follow anything he says he wants others to do??? a good quote from before he filed the patent application tim o'reilly says patents are ok, he's just against stupid patents. in the spirit of touch of grey, tim man, patents are lockin of the worst kind. there's no way to route around them. 9402 60651 am  discuss when's a permalink not a permalink? when dave writes an item, then removes it!!!!!!!!!!! the permalink links to nothing at that point. so apparently the ""perma"" part in permalink is permanent. for everyone except dave. too bad his little attempt at a definition fails to mention this...!!!!!!!!! 9202 61603 pm  discuss",[],8933,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(or anything very close to that?) perhaps not. based on an exhaustive search of the paper and audio records of the dirksen congressional center, staffers there have found no evidence that dirksen ever uttered the phrase popularly attributed to him. archivists undertook the search after studying research statistics showing that more than 25 percent of inquiries have to do with the quote or its variations. here is what they examined all of the existing audio tapes of the famed ""ev and charlie"" and ""ev and jerry"" shows, all newspapers clippings in the dirksen papers, about 12,500 pages of dirksen's own speech notes, transcripts of his speeches and media appearances, transcripts of republican leadership press conferences, and dirksen's statements on the senate floor as documented in the congressional record. although dirksen rarely prepared the text of a speech, preferring to rely on notes, he did employ brief phrases to remind him of a particular turn of phrase. for example, in referring to the public debt or excessive government spending, dirksen would jot the word ""pothole"" to remind him to tell the following story, on this occasion in reference to the debt ceiling ""as i think of this bill, and the fact that the more progress we make the deeper we go into the hole, i am reminded of a group of men who were working on a street. they had dug quite a number of holes. when they got through, they failed to puddle or tamp the earth when it was returned to the hole, and they had a nice little mound, which was quite a traffic hazard. ""not knowing what to do with it, they sat down on the curb and had a conference. after a while, one of the fellows snapped his fingers and said, i have it. i know how we will get rid of that overriding earth and remove the hazard. we will just dig the hole deeper.'"" congressional record, june 16, 1965, p. 13884. on the same occasion, dirksen relied on yet another ""spending"" story, one he labeled ""cat in the well"" ""one time in the house of representatives a colleague told me a story about a proposition that a teacher put to a boy. he said, johnny, a cat fell in a well 100 feet deep. suppose that cat climbed up 1 foot and then fell back 2 feet. how long would it take the cat to get out of the well?' ""johnny worked assiduously with his slate and slate pencil for quite a while, and then when the teacher came down and said, how are you getting along?' johnny said, teacher, if you give me another slate and a couple of slate pencils, i am pretty sure that in the next 30 minutes i can land that cat in hell.' ""if some people get any cheer our of a $328 billion debt ceiling, i do not find much to cheer about concerning it."" congressional record, june 16, 1965, p. 13884. but there are no such reminders for the ""a billion here, a billion there . . . "" tag line as there surely should have been given dirksen's notemaking tendencies. he spoke often and passionately about the debt ceiling, federal spending, and the growth of government. yet there is no authoritative reference to the ""billion"" phrase. the chief evidence in support of dirksen making the statement comes from people who claim to have heard him. the library of congress, for example, cites someone's personal observation on the campaign trail as evidence. the dirksen center has received calls from people who heard dirksen say those words, some even providing the date of the event. but crosschecking that information with the records has, so far, turned up nothing in the way of confirmation. the closest documented statement came at a joint senatehouse republican leadership press conference on march 8, 1962, when dirksen said, ""the favorite sum of money is $1 billion  a billion a year for a fatter federal payroll, a billion here, a billion there."" emd papers, republican congressional leadership file, f. 25 but the ""and pretty soon you're talking real money"" is missing. in another close call, the new york times, january 23, 1961, quoted dirksen ""look at education  twoandonehalf billion  a billion for this, a billion for that, a billion for something else. three to five billion for public works. you haven't got any budget balance left. you'll be deeply in the red."" cited in byron hulsey's ""everett dirksen and the modern presidents,"" ph.d. dissertation (may 1998, university of texas, p. 226 of course, the dirksen papers do not document completely the late senator's comments. for example, the center that bears his name does not have his testimony before committees. their collection of congressional records ends in 1965, omitting the last four years of dirksen's life and career  he might have employed the phrase only late, although witnesses claim he said it throughout his career. dirksen's campaign speeches tended not to produce transcripts, only sketchy notes or abbreviated newspaper accounts. dirksen also held center stage before the video age, meaning that many remarks, particularly those in campaigns, escaped capture. bottom line the late senate minority leader certainly would have endorsed the meaning behind the phrase, but it is questionable that he ever coined it.  my permanent email address is",[],6287,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(remembering to never ever ever power up your system without a heatsink  fan). if after reseating the cpu into the mobo... you still get no beep codes, from it with just the cpu inserted into the mobo ie(no pci,isa cards or and no actual ide or floppy cables connected to the system)... even though you have power... you either have a faulty motherboard or a faulty cpu. once you get beep codes various permutations of the above should eventually disjunct which device it is, is causing the lack of post. power on self test. bod  irish linux users' group for (un)subscription information. list maintainer",[],2317,0,0,easy_ham_testing

(given the market share of macs2 (about 3.5%) and the market share of netscape3 (about 3.4%), that is not a silly comparison.) robb beal wrote4 ""try this test. go to a venture firm, angel, or big company with a mac os x productconceptprototype. do they consider the fact that it's a mac application a net plus?
