# AI Phishing Detection Dissertation

This project proposes the creation of an advanced AI system specifically designed to identify and prevent phishing attacks conveyed through email. Phishing attacks, which trick individuals into divulging sensitive information or downloading malware, are increasingly sophisticated and represent a significant cybersecurity threat. This project aims to leverage the latest advancements in machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to analyse email content, metadata, and sending patterns to distinguish between legitimate and phishing emails accurately.

The system will be designed to adapt and learn from new phishing techniques continually, employing algorithms that can evolve with the threat landscape. It will not only examine the textual content of emails for common phishing indicators (such as urgent language, suspicious links, or anomalies in the sender's information) but will also analyse the context and subtleties that may betray a phishing attempt. This approach aims to significantly reduce the likelihood of successful phishing attacks, thereby protecting users' sensitive information and enhancing overall cybersecurity.
